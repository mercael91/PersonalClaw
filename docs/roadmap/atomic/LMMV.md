# LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2 — atomic plans

**Source plan:** [`LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2`](../plans/LOCAL-MODEL-MANAGER-V2.md)  
**Code:** `LMMV`  
**Source status:** in_progress

7 atoms: 1 done (the §4.4/§4.2 layouts.py probe, PR #120, half-inert), 6 todo mapping to the plan's 5 declared sessions with Session 5 split into independent subscription-creds (§8) and a hardening/validation capstone. No cross-plan dependencies — this is a Wave-0, v2-independent floor.

Each atom below executes start-to-finish in one go. If an atom lists dependencies, they must be `done` before it starts — that is the whole point of the split: no atom should ever need pausing to go execute other work.

## Atom scopes

### `LMMV-1` — Shared multi-layout downloaded/delete probe + cleanup-candidate detection (local_models/layouts.py)

**Status:** done (PR ##120)

§4.4 One multi-layout downloaded/delete probe; §4.2 cleanup-candidate detection helpers

**Done when:** local_models/layouts.py exports is_downloaded / delete_all_layouts (greedy, all copies) / downloaded_layouts / candidate_paths / reclaimable_bytes / hf_repo_dirname probing save()/HF models-- snapshot/direct-file layouts, with partials excluded from 'downloaded'; tests/test_local_model_layouts.py (47 cases) green; is_downloaded wired into dashboard/model_downloads.py job runner as the asymmetric 'second opinion'. NOTE HALF-INERT: only is_downloaded has a production caller — delete/cleanup helpers remain unwired (finished by LMMV-3).

### `LMMV-2` — Session 1 — Catalog & contract: CapabilityMatrix, runtime-contract/license fields, declarative catalog.json loader + truncation detector, available payload + ModelsPanel chips

**Status:** todo

§2.1 Structured capability matrix on LocalModel; §2.2 Runtime-contract metadata + license surfacing; §2.3 Declarative model-card catalog with truncation detection

**Done when:** CapabilityMatrix (optional, default None) plus runtime/runtime_contract/license/non_commercial/context_tokens/output_tokens/io_mime fields added additively to LocalModel; LocalModelProvider._models_from_catalog() reads app-owned catalog.json, filters platforms against host, and computes downloaded via the §4.4 probe; truncation detector flags on-disk <60% of size_mb (with config_only escape hatch) as integrity:truncated + Repair affordance; the fixed-catalog five migrated to catalog.json (dropping a new entry makes a model appear/download/bind/RUN, deprecated shows a chip without breaking bindings); GET /api/models/available serializes the new fields; ModelsPanel renders matrix/license/non-commercial/deprecation/integrity chips (Success Criteria 6 & 7).

### `LMMV-3` — Session 2 — Download Manager v2: canonical job record, poll-first reattach, .part + cleanup candidates, gated/network/disk error classification, wire delete_all_layouts

**Status:** todo

§4.1 Canonical server-side progress record; §4.2 .part atomic writes + cleanup candidates; §4.3 Gated-repo error translation; §9 download_parallelism config field

**Done when:** ModelDownloadJob.to_dict() emits the one canonical shape (kind/state/progress/reason typed string); FE owns no download state — on mount/tab-switch it polls GET /api/models/downloads and reattaches progress bars, never orphaning a bar on reload (Success Criterion 2); GET /api/models/downloads/cleanup-candidates + POST .../cleanup power a 'Reclaim N GB' affordance in ModelsPanel; the delete route drives layouts.delete_all_layouts (closes the still-live disk-never-frees bug, completing the half-inert LMMV-1 helpers); cancel records the partial as a cleanup candidate; runner-driven direct-URL fetches write .part then os.replace; fetch failures classified gated_repo:no_token / gated_repo:license_not_accepted / network / disk_full with the FE translation table + deep links (failed-gated never auto-retried); ollama PullProgress mapped onto the canonical record inside _ManagerBackedLocalProvider.

### `LMMV-4` — Session 3 — HF token cascade (3-source, whoami-validated) + per-provider real-inference selftest & health endpoints

**Status:** core done (PR pending) — the full core mechanism landed; the pyannote-app
delegation is a scoped cross-repo follow-on (see the Execution log 2026-08-08 entry in the
source plan). `local_models/hf_token.py` (re-exported via `sdk.credentials`) resolves the
3-source cascade whoami-validated through the `net.fetch` CONNECTOR chokepoint;
`GET /api/models/hf-token/status` + `PUT /api/models/hf-token` (masked previews only,
SEL-logged); `GET /api/models/local/{provider}/health` (never 500s, ABC
`availability_detail()`); `POST /api/models/local/{provider}/selftest` (real per-capability
inference, `single_flight`-serialized, `selftest_timeout_s`-bounded, typed reasons); the
§4.3 gated pre-warn consumes cascade presence server-side; ModelsPanel renders the token
section + inline Test buttons; config `whoami_ttl_s`/`selftest_timeout_s` round-trip.

§5 HF Token Cascade; §6 Per-Provider Real-Inference Selftest + Health; §4.3 gated pre-warn (token-status-aware); §9 whoami_ttl_s / selftest_timeout_s config fields

**Done when:** local_models/hf_token.py (re-exported via sdk.credentials) resolves credential-store(.env) → HF_TOKEN/legacy env → ~/.cache/huggingface/token, first whoami-valid source wins via the net.fetch CONNECTOR egress chokepoint (cached ~whoami_ttl_s); GET /api/models/hf-token/status returns per-source {present,valid,username?,masked} with values never leaving the server unmasked (Success Criterion 4); a set/clear field writes source 1 and diarization-pyannote._hf_token() delegates to the cascade (its app-config field honored one release then migrated); GET /api/models/local/{provider}/health never 500s (uses ABC availability_detail()); POST .../selftest runs a real per-capability inference (bundled fixtures, single_flight-serialized, bounded timeout, user-click only) returning typed reasons so a pyannote-4-style contract break fails on API not file presence (Success Criterion 5); Test buttons render inline in ModelsPanel; SEL logs token set/clear; the gated pre-warn consumes cascade status server-side.

### `LMMV-5` — Session 4 — Sidecar isolation runner + resumable install jobs + loaded-models/memory-pressure widget

**Status:** todo

§3 Sidecar Isolation (dedicated-venv subprocesses); §3.2 Resumable install jobs; §7 Loaded-Models / Memory-Pressure Widget; §9 pressure_warn_pct / sidecar_restart_max config fields

**Done when:** local_models/sidecar.py runner owns a per-app dedicated venv, a newline-JSON stdio child (5 verbs), process-generation counters, and a watchdog; ProviderConfig gains execution: in-process|sidecar (default in-process, PROVIDER_TYPES/handler set untouched); the sentence-transformers sidecar variant, killed mid-encode, keeps the gateway alive, raises typed SidecarCrashed, respawns, and search recovers without restart (Success Criterion 1); resumable/idempotent install jobs run on ModelDownloadRegistry via GET /api/models/sidecar/{provider}/install/status (steps/log_tail/remediation, DELETE refuses 409 while running); GET /api/models/loaded + POST /api/models/unload back a compact FE loaded-models section (rows + Unload + pressure bar) and a Dashboard bento 'On this machine' tile via ABC loaded_models()/unload()/ensure_ready(); Unload frees RSS per the pressure snapshot and a model resident after a binding switch shows is_active:false (Success Criterion 8); child-reported rss_mb stat frames feed the widget.

### `LMMV-6` — Session 5a — Subscription-credential model providers (credential_source resolver + one reference app)

**Status:** todo

§8 Subscription-Credential Model Providers (am.d)

**Done when:** BrandedProviderSpec (sdk/provider_helpers.py) gains credential_source; _factory's credential order becomes entry.credential → options.api_key → subscription-source resolver → spec.api_key_env → anon placeholder; the resolver reads the named agent CLI's own credential store read-only (e.g. claude-code OAuth/keychain); not-logged-in fails soft/typed via providers/loader.py availability() reporting (False, 'sign in with `claude login` first') so the extensions list greys it out with the reason; ONE reference model-provider app ships (PersonalClawApps) riding CLI auth with no separate API key, sessions/models/catalogs flowing through the normal branded-app path (no agent runtime involved).

### `LMMV-7` — Session 5b — Hardening: per-model context-budget helper, refresh/registry-drift/destructive-test regressions, full-matrix as-a-user validation

**Status:** todo

§2.2 per-model context-budget helper; §11 Disposition invariants; §12 risk regressions; Success Criteria 9 & 10; Session 5 as-a-user validation sweep

**Done when:** A budget-derivation helper in local_models/ is consumed by the reasoning-axis one_shot_completion path, deriving budgets from catalog context_tokens/output_tokens instead of hardcoded constants (no compaction logic rewritten); regression tests lock: (a) refresh_providers() leaves every bundled/sidecar provider registered — the two-population invariant (Success Criterion 9), (b) a sidecar proxy registered through ModelTypeHandler keeps the APP-name key + is_local_model_provider duck-type + refresh survival (registry-drift), (c) a suite-level fixture asserts no fs-touching test can reach a real model dir / cache root — only tmp_path (Success Criterion 10, the bound-model-deletion incident unreproducible by construction); the full download/delete/bind/RUN matrix across all 6 providers is validated as a user through the new surfaces.
