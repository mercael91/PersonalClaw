# The App Platform

Apps are how PersonalClaw grows capabilities without core edits: model
providers, channels, agents, search engines, tools, and full backend+UI
dashboards are all apps. This doc covers the runtime: install/update
lifecycle, the security scan, the backend subprocess model, the permission
system, crons, and the MCP bridge. Paths are relative to
`PersonalClaw/src/personalclaw/`.

## Three tiers

| Tier | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Native (32) | `apps/native/` in-package | seeded on first run, locked on (e.g. `native-agents`, `personalclaw-memory`, `ollama-models`, `bundled-chat`, the action bundles); may own its provider code — see [the native capability contract](#the-native-capability-contract-appsnative_contractpy) |
| First-party (68) | workspace `apps/` | Slack channel, hosted model providers, speech, Minutes/Growth dashboards |
| Third-party | user sources → `~/.personalclaw/apps/` | fixtures at `third-party-apps/` (`hello-search`, `demo-dashboard`) |

The gateway loads **installed copies** at `~/.personalclaw/apps/<name>/`.
Editing the repo `apps/` tree does nothing to a running gateway until you push
it via `POST /api/apps/{name}/update`, which runs the new code at once (see
[Unload and load](#unload-and-load-appsapp_runtimepy)). App sources for the Store are managed at
`/api/apps/sources` (`dashboard/handlers/apps.py`).

## Install lifecycle (`apps/app_manager.py`)

Install is: **copy → stage in quarantine → validate manifest → scan staged
content → platform gate → consent → pip deps → `setup.onInstall` hook (bounded
subprocess, 60s cap) → register providers/prompts/MCP servers/crons → start
backend**.

- **Quarantine first** — staged under `~/.personalclaw/apps/.quarantine/`;
  dangerous content never touches the live tree.
- **Staging never follows a link** (`apps/staging.py`) — install, update and the
  install preview copy the bundle from one survey of the whole tree, taken before
  anything is written, and every later gate reads that copy. A link to one of the
  bundle's own files is kept as that link. Anything that brings in bytes from
  elsewhere, or could, is refused with the offending path named: an absolute link,
  a link that leaves the bundle for even one step, a link to a folder (the scan does
  not descend into one), a link to nothing, a loop, a hard link to an outside file, a
  pipe, socket or device, a link into or out of `data/`, and `data` or
  `installed.json` as a link. A `repo#subdirectory` pointer must stay inside its
  clone. The gateway's own copies of an app's `data/` (update, keep-data uninstall,
  restore) copy links as links, and the gateway's own reads of files there (the
  app's `data/config.json`, for the config API, provider settings and the boot-time
  secret move) never follow a link (`apps/manager.read_app_owned_text`).
- **Tooling is never installed** — staging leaves out every entry named in
  `supply_chain.NEVER_INSTALLED_NAMES`, at any depth and in any letter case: `.git`,
  `.hg`, `.svn` (version-control metadata, whose tools run what it names),
  `__pycache__` (bytecode the interpreter would run instead of the scanned source)
  and `.venv`, `venv`, `.tox` (virtualenvs; the platform installs
  `pythonDependencies` itself). What is left out is not scanned, not in the consent
  digest and not installed; a link into it is refused. Everything else is the app,
  `node_modules` included: a JavaScript app's dependencies are code it runs, so they
  install and are scanned like any other file. Skills follow the same rule
  (`skills.marketplace.install_scanned`).
- **The scan** is the shared `SkillScanner` (`supply_chain.py`), and it reads the
  whole staged tree: no folder is skipped, every file a rule reads is read whole (up
  to 16 MB), and a file it cannot read is an `unscanned_file` finding in the review,
  never a silent pass. A *dangerous*
  verdict (or an invalid signature) is a terminal refusal, **non-overridable**.
  Each finding carries whether the code it sits in can run (`reachability`) and
  whether anything the app runs loads its file at all (`runtime` — the install
  dialog groups an app's own test files apart from the code it runs).
- **A registry listing names a remote repository** — a `repo` in a source's
  `app-registry.json` must be a plain `https://` URL (no credentials, no port), the
  form the published registry requires. A listing naming a local path, `file://`,
  `ssh`, `git@…` or `http://` is not listed. Installing a folder on this machine is
  the owner's own act (Install from URL, or adding the folder as a source).
- **Every install waits for consent** — a clean scan is not consent.
  `POST /api/apps/preview {source}` stages the source and returns what installing
  it grants and runs (`apps/disclosure.describe`: permissions, scheduled jobs and
  whether each is switched on, Python packages, dashboard code, its own server
  process, the install hook, MCP servers), the scan, and a `consent` digest of the
  staged bytes. `POST /api/apps {source, consent}` commits only if the bytes still
  have that digest; anything else — `confirm: true` included — answers 409 with
  the review. The install invariant is scanned-bytes == reviewed-bytes ==
  installed-bytes (no swap-after-scan window, and none after consent either).
- **Update** is atomic with rollback: the previous install is preserved at
  `~/.personalclaw/apps/.{name}.rollback` for the duration. An update that changes
  what the app gets (compared with the installed copy's disclosure), or scans with
  warnings, needs the same `consent` digest (`POST /api/apps/preview {source, name}`);
  one that changes none of it needs none.
- **Removal** distinguishes deactivate (providers deregistered, files kept)
  from force-uninstall.

## Unload and load (`apps/app_runtime.py`)

Every lifecycle step that starts or stops an app goes through one pair, so an update, an
uninstall and a reinstall all leave exactly the version on disk running:

- **`load(manifest)`** — install, enable, and the end of an update: register the providers
  (which imports the app's code from its files now), seed its prompts and skills, write its MCP
  servers, register its proposal kinds, start its backend and its background worker.
- **`unload(name, manifest)`** — disable, the three uninstall rungs, and the start of an update:
  stop and hold the backend and the worker (neither watchdog starts a held app, so no process
  comes back from the old files before the swap), drop the MCP servers and close the processes
  they spawned, disable the providers (a channel's receiver stops with them, and the unload waits
  for it), take back what the app's code registered, remove its prompts, skills and proposal
  kinds, and forget its availability answers.

**Taking the code back** (`personalclaw/app_code.py`). The loader claims an app's directory
before it runs any of its code. Each registry app code can write to through the SDK — model types
and catalogs, media catalogs and scanners, subscription sources, `acp:` runtime entries, sidecar
runners, trust-mode callbacks — records how to take an entry back, and an entry is the app's when
the app's code made the call; a core module that registers its own type while the app's import
pulls it in stays core's. `release(name)` runs those take-backs, removes every module loaded from
the app's directory from `sys.modules` (and its cached bytecode, since the next version's file
reuses the path), and reports what Python cannot take back:

| Left in the process | Why it stays | What the owner sees |
|---|---|---|
| a compiled extension module the app loaded | Python cannot unload one | a restart reason naming it |
| a thread still running the app's code | nothing can stop an arbitrary thread | a restart reason naming it |
| a task suspended in the app's code | it would resume the old code | a restart reason naming it |
| a package in `app-python` the gateway had loaded, replaced by the update | an interpreter keeps the version it imported first | a restart reason naming the packages |

A restart reason is the update's `restart_reason` (with `restart_required`), the toast that
reports the update, and the app panel's "Restart the gateway to finish" notice
(`GET /api/apps` → `restartReason`) — kept in memory only, since a restart is what clears it. The
Library re-reads the list when its socket reopens, so the notice goes when the restart is done. A
chat turn already in flight finishes on the provider instance it started with; the next one
builds from the new code.

**The restart itself** re-executes the gateway in place (`os.execve`, same PID), so before it
does, `stop_processes()` stops every app backend and worker (watchdogs first). A process left
running would stay a child of the new image, which neither supervises it nor reaps it at boot
(only a process whose parent died counts as an orphan there).

**UI bundles** are served with `Cache-Control: no-cache`, and every bundle URL carries the app's
`uiRevision` (a digest of the bundles its manifest declares), so a tab that already imported the
old module imports the new one.

## Permissions (`apps/permissions.py`)

The manifest's `permissions` block is enforced, with one documented exception
(`network`, which the consent surface marks advisory):

| Permission | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| `api` | prefix-allowlist middleware over gateway API paths — pathname only, query string stripped (server and SDK agree on this). Two halves no declaration widens: the owner-only registry (`OWNER_ONLY_API_PATHS`, whole subtrees such as `/api/mcp` and `/api/terminal`), and `ROUTE_AUTHZ`, which declares each write route in a security family (`SECURITY_ROUTE_FAMILIES`: automations, apps, packs, agents and agent definitions, skills, prompts and snippets, the orchestrator's routing notes, config, devices, channels…) `OwnerOnly` or `AppMay` with a reason. Every write to an agent, a skill or a prompt is `OwnerOnly` — they are the instructions your agents carry out with your tools — so an app ships skills in its manifest's `skills` and runs agent work through its `agent` grant. Your conversations are families too (chat, sessions, rooms, inbox, reveal): an `AppMay` row that carries `owns` names where the route addresses a conversation, and the middleware refuses one the calling app did not start (`_ChatSession.created_by_app`); a row marked `agent_work` (a turn) also needs the `agent` grant. Those families declare their READS route by route too (`READ_DECLARED_FAMILIES`): a read of one conversation carries `owns`, a list or a search answers an app with its own conversations only, and rooms and the inbox are the owner's. Your notification log is declared the same way: `GET /api/notifications` answers an app with the notifications it raised and those about a conversation it started (`DashboardState.notification_reaches`), and your notification settings and rules are the owner's. What you dictate is a family too (`/api/lexicon`): every write but the graph resync is `OwnerOnly`, because a term or a correction rewrites your transcripts, and its reads stay the allowlist's. A write route in any family, or a read in a declared-read family, that has no declaration is refused to every app (`undeclared_security_route`); `HEAD` answers from the `GET` row |
| `config` | the exact settings (`voice.echo_filter_enabled`) `/api/config` reaches for this app. A second declaration on top of `api`, which must still name `/api/config` for the route. `GET /api/config/personalclaw` returns these fields and nothing else, and a write to any other answers `403 config_field_not_declared`. Deny by default. Naming a security setting is an install error (`manifest._config_permission_errors`) |
| `events` | WebSocket fan-out filter — an app's socket only receives event types it declared, a frame about a conversation only when the app started that conversation, and an inbox item only when the app raised it (`dashboard/ws_state.py::frame_subject`); its session list holds its own rows, and a notification frame (the note, or `notification_logged`/`_removed`/`_ack`/`_unack` naming notes by `ts`) reaches it only about a notification it raised or one about a conversation it started. The envelope is `type` and `data`, so nothing on it says whether your tool calls run without asking. An app that may read `/api/approvals` (the approval relay) also hears the approval frames for yours |
| `eventSubscriptions` | which **platform** events (`apps/app_events.py`: `session.created`, `knowledge.ingested`, `task.completed`) are delivered to the app. A DIFFERENT axis from `events` above, deliberately: `events` is the WS type allowlist, these are core-emitted facts, and holding one grants nothing about the other. `app_events.emit` is the only delivery path and is the whole gate — deny by default and **exact name only** (no prefix, no `*`), so a typo denies rather than widens. Delivered into the app's broker-owned inbox (the `appMessaging` queue, sender `@platform`, which no app can be named), drained over `GET /api/apps/message`. Payloads carry identifiers only, never prose: a subscription grants timing, not content an app's `api` scope may not cover. |
| `mcpTools` | which MCP tools the app may invoke |
| `memory` | one boolean grant on `/api/memory/*` and `/api/lessons` (`permissions.MEMORY_API_PATHS` — a lesson is a memory record every agent is handed as a rule), refused unless declared. NOT a tier: this was `"app-scoped"`/`"shared"` until #3501 and `app-scoped` granted nothing on any path — the checker only answered True for it when asked about the app-scoped scope, and the gateway's single call site asked about `"shared"`. Deleted rather than implemented: core has no per-app memory partition (`memory_record.MemoryScope` is `session\|workspace\|agent\|global`), so the schema was offering a choice that did nothing on a *permission* the user approves at install. A leftover string value is an install error, never reinterpreted. |
| `cron` | whether manifest crons register |
| `storage` | a private DATA_DIR handed to the backend; the one folder `/api/reveal` shows or opens for the app |
| `agent` | two independent gates for agent invocation; also the grant a turn in the app's own conversation needs, which then approves by this grant and never by your approval switches (`permissions.app_conversation_auto_approves`, bounded by the operator ceiling) |
| `appMessaging` | which apps this app may send a brokered message to — `POST /api/apps/message` is the only app-to-app path and refuses an undeclared target `403` + SEL. Deny by default: declaring nothing means it can message no app. Install consent names each target, rendering a trailing-`*` entry as the name prefix it is (`PermissionList`), because the grant covers every current and future app under that prefix. |
| `network` | **DECLARATION-ONLY, unenforced by design** — there is no per-app chokepoint: provider code is imported in-process by the gateway, and an app backend is its own OS process with its own network stack. So it is disclosure, and the Store consent surface says so: the network claim renders outside the enforced-permission list, labelled advisory, whether or not the app declares it (`PermissionList`) — neither its presence nor its absence reads as containment. Gateway-mediated reach is separately bounded by `api`. See [security/limitations.md](../security/limitations.md#2-the-app-network-permission-is-declaration-only). |

The app identity claim is adopted in **all** auth modes — including
`AUTH_MODE=none`, where a dedicated middleware still extracts the app token so
the permission sandbox holds even with auth off (see
[security.md](security.md#auth-modes)).

## Backend subprocess model (`apps/backend_runtime.py`)

An app with a backend gets its own subprocess:

- auto-assigned port + health check on start;
- a **30-second watchdog** (`start_backend_watchdog`) revives crashed
  backends;
- **PPID-guarded orphan reaping** — after a hard gateway kill, orphaned
  backends re-parent to init; only processes with PPID 1 are reaped, so a
  live sibling's process is never touched;
- `PERSONALCLAW_SKIP_APP_BACKENDS=1` disables backend spawning (test
  isolation).

### The backend environment — an allowlist, not an inheritance

A backend does **not** inherit the gateway's environment. It receives
`sandbox.build_child_env(site="app-backend")`: the `CHILD_ENV_BASE_NAMES`
allowlist (`PATH`, `HOME`, `TMPDIR`, `XDG_*`, locale/`TZ`, proxy + CA vars,
`PYTHONPATH`, and the three `PERSONALCLAW_HOME`/`_WORKSPACE`/`_PORT` vars) plus
any name the operator declared in `sandbox.env_passthrough`, layered with the
four variables the supervisor **computes**:

| variable | when |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | always — the resolved backend port |
| `PERSONALCLAW_APP_NAME` | always |
| `PERSONALCLAW_APP_SECRET` | always (the proxy-signature secret; fail-closed) |
| `PERSONALCLAW_APP_DATA_DIR` | only when the app declares the `storage` capability |

**Why.** An app backend is the least-trusted long-lived child in the tree —
third-party code, scanned but not trusted at install, running for as long as the
app is enabled. `config/loader.py` deliberately seeds `~/.personalclaw/.env`
credentials into `os.environ` so "trusted children" inherit them, so a full
`os.environ` copy handed every one of those credentials to every installed app's
backend. Measured on a real gateway: the pre-change copy delivered ~130
variables the backend had no declared need for, including `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, AWS
region/SDK vars and the operator's git identity.

**If a backend needs one more variable,** the operator declares it by name in
`sandbox.env_passthrough` (`config.json`). That is an operator surface on
purpose — it is not reachable from a manifest or a trigger payload, because an
app-declared name would be an exfiltration channel. Note that the declaration is
**global**, not per-site: a name declared there reaches every child site (cron,
bash action, app backend). Withheld names are logged at DEBUG against the
`app-backend` site, so an app author whose variable stopped arriving can see
exactly which one was dropped and why. `BackendConfig` has no `env` field — an
app cannot declare its own environment.

The `storage` gate is enforced **after** the build: `PERSONALCLAW_APP_DATA_DIR`
is popped when the app lacks the capability, so declaring that name in
`sandbox.env_passthrough` cannot hand every storage-less backend a data dir and
quietly undo sandbox P3.

### The reverse proxy & token model

`dashboard/handlers/apps.py::api_app_proxy` forwards
`/apps/{name}/api/{tail}` to the app's backend, and is where the credential
boundary lives:

- the owner's session credential (cookie + `Authorization`) and any inbound
  app-identity headers are **stripped** — an app backend must never see a
  token it could replay against the full gateway API;
- a **fresh 1-hour app-scoped Bearer token** (`generate_token(user,
  app=name)`, `_APP_TOKEN_TTL_SECS = 3600`) plus `X-PersonalClaw-App` are
  injected, so the backend has an identity bounded to its own declared
  permissions.

That boundary is about what the proxy hands a backend. A backend on the host is still a
process under the owner's account, so it can read the home directly, `session_key` (the
token-signing key) included. A backend that names a sandbox tier runs under that tier's
confinement instead — see
[security/limitations.md §7](../security/limitations.md#7-an-apps-own-code-runs-as-you).

### Inbound authentication — the proxy signature (what loopback does NOT buy)

The token model above is the **outbound** boundary (what the backend may do
back at the gateway). The **inbound** boundary is separate and, until this was
added, missing: a backend binds `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral port>` — a *network*
boundary, not an *authorization* one. Loopback keeps off-box hosts out; it does
**not** keep out other local processes. Before the fix, any local process that
found the port could talk to the backend **directly**, bypassing the proxy and
therefore session auth and `app_permission_middleware` entirely. The app
platform's whole permission story assumes requests arrive through the proxy —
so that assumption is now enforced, not merely documented.

Every request the proxy forwards carries an HMAC signature the backend verifies
**fail-closed**:

- **Header:** `X-PersonalClaw-Proxy: <ts>:<hmac_hex>`.
- **Signed message:** `<ts>:<METHOD>:<raw_path?query>:<sha256_hex(body)>` —
  binding the method, the exact wire path (aiohttp's `request.raw_path`), and a
  hash of the body, so none can be altered in transit.
- **Window:** `ts` is an integer unix second; a signature more than **±60s**
  from now is refused (replay protection). The compare is constant-time
  (`hmac.compare_digest`).
- **Secret:** a per-app 256-bit key at `apps_dir()/<app>/.app_secret`, minted
  0600 on first backend start and injected into the child via
  `PERSONALCLAW_APP_SECRET`. It is never logged.
- **Verifier:** `personalclaw.sdk.security.require_proxy_signature()`, an
  aiohttp middleware every first-party backend installs (and every third-party
  backend should). It reads the body once and stashes it on
  `request["body_bytes"]` so a route reads it without consuming the single-read
  stream twice.
- **`/health` is exempt.** The 30-second watchdog probes the backend by process
  liveness today, but the health *path* is reserved for direct probing, so it
  must not require a signature — otherwise a direct health probe could never
  succeed.

**Fail-closed, both ends.** The mint is fail-closed: a backend that cannot
write/read its secret does **not** start (better missing than unprotected). The
verify is fail-closed: no secret in the environment, or an absent / malformed /
stale / mismatched signature, returns `401` and the route body never runs.

**What this does and does not buy.** It proves a request *came from the gateway
proxy* (which itself enforced session auth + permissions), so it closes the
direct-to-port bypass. It does **not** encrypt the loopback traffic, and it does
**not** defend against a local process that can read the 0600 secret file — on a
single-user machine an attacker with the owner's file access has already lost
the game. It raises the bar from "any local process" to "a process that can read
a root-only-readable file," which is the boundary a single-user posture supports.
Denials are logged (a structured stderr warning in the app process, since a
backend has no access to the gateway's SecurityEventLog).

## The App SDK

- **Python**: `sdk/` is THE stable app-facing import surface —
  apps import core **only** via `personalclaw.sdk.*`
  (boundary-lint-enforced by `tests/test_apps_import_boundary.py`). Modules
  cover models, channels, tools, search, memory, knowledge, STT/TTS,
  credentials, settings (`ProviderSettings` — each app's persisted store),
  security helpers, and `provider_helpers.register_branded_app` for
  protocol-thin branded model apps.
- **Its signatures are a reviewed contract**: every name each `sdk` module publishes
  is recorded in `src/personalclaw/sdk/signatures.json`
  (`scripts/sdk_signature_snapshot.py`), `tests/test_sdk_signature_snapshot.py`
  fails until a change is regenerated into it, and writing it refuses a parameter
  that changed type in place (an old caller would still bind). CI's `apps-contract`
  job runs the first-party apps' SDK contract checks against a change that touches
  the SDK (`scripts/apps_sdk_contract.py`). The rule for contributors:
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#sdk-changes).
- **Frontend**: `web/src/app/appSdk.tsx` — a contributed UI gets
  `createAppApi` / `createAppEvents` and mounts via `mount(el, ctx)`; the host
  resolves bare `react` / `@personalclaw/app-sdk` imports so app UIs don't
  bundle their own React.

### The UI SDK's gated subpaths (APE-11)

Two subpaths sit beside the base module, each unlocked by one entry in the manifest's
top-level `uiCapabilities` list (closed vocabulary: `UI_CAPABILITIES` in
`apps/manifest.py`, mirrored by the `UiCapability` union in `appSdk.tsx` — a test pins
the two together):

| Import | Declaration | Exports |
|---|---|---|
| `@personalclaw/app-sdk/ui` | `shell-primitives` | `Button`, `Surface`, `useTheme`, `readAppTheme` |
| `@personalclaw/app-sdk/genui` | `generative-widget` | `GenerativeWidget` |
| `@personalclaw/app-sdk/genui` | `generative-component` | `registerComponent`, `unregisterComponents` |

`Button`/`Surface` are the host's OWN components by identity, not copies, so a page built
from them renders markup identical to a native page's — which is what
`web/src/app/appSdkUi.test.tsx` asserts, by loading a fixture bundle through
`ContributedPage` and diffing its output against the same page written natively. `useTheme`
/`readAppTheme` return the resolved token contract (`colors` + spreadable `cssVars`), so an
app never names a host CSS variable directly.

`GenerativeWidget` takes a genui DSL body and hands it to the HOST renderer, which validates
every line against the host's own component registry (`ui/genui/registry.ts`). Authoring
surface for the DSL is `library.prompt()`.

**Contributing a component TYPE** is the separate reading APE-11 deferred, and AMBIENT-SURFACES
AS-6 landed it under `generative-component` — a distinct declaration, because supplying a DSL
body and extending the component vocabulary are different trust edges and one must not grant
the other. An app declares `ui.components` (a module whose `register(sdk, ctx)` export calls
`sdk.registerComponent(ctx, def)`); the SHELL loads it for every enabled declaring app, so a
chat-born widget can name the component without the user ever opening that app's page. Four
properties keep the safety model intact:

- **additive only** — an app registration is an L1 layer entry that may add a name, never
  shadow a core one (refused at register time, so model-authored `Table(…)` always reaches the
  core `Table`);
- **host-validated** — the component declares its args to the host registry and is validated
  by it like any core component;
- **error-boundaried** — it renders inside a `LayerBoundary`, so a throwing app component
  cannot blank the surface it was composed into;
- **removed on disable** — the same sync pass that loads a module drops the components of any
  app that is no longer enabled or no longer declares the capability, and they leave
  `library.prompt()` with it.

**The gate is a declaration, not a sandbox.** `resolvableAppSpecs()` omits an undeclared
subpath from the bundle's import rewrite, so its bare import fails to resolve — but a
contributed page already runs in the host React tree (`ContributedPage` mounts it with
`createRoot`, no iframe) with the host `window`, so an undeclared app is not *prevented*
from reaching the same components. What the block buys is legibility: the app states which
host surfaces it builds on, in one place the host can read. Same posture as
`permissions.network` — advisory, and never presented as enforced.

## The native capability contract (`apps/native_contract.py`)

A **bundled** app may own its own provider code, not just declare a capability core
implements. Historically every bundled app was `app.json`-only: its
`provider.implementation` named a core dotted path
(`personalclaw.tasks.native:create_provider`), so growing that capability meant editing
core — the one thing this platform exists to avoid.

**How a bundled app owns a provider**

1. Ship `provider.py` next to `app.json` in `apps/native/<name>/`.
2. Point the manifest at the bundle-relative module:
   `"implementation": "provider:create_provider"`. A module path with **no dot** is
   bundle-relative; a dotted one is still a core/package path, so existing bundles are
   untouched.
3. Import core **only** through `personalclaw.sdk.*`.

**Allowed imports = the published SDK, and nothing else.** This is deliberately the SAME
rule installed apps live under, not a second, narrower "native SDK" allowlist: a bundled
app is loaded by the same `providers/loader.py` seam, registered through the same typed
handler, and shipped by the same release, so a separate list would be a second boundary to
keep in step for no gain. Every `sdk/` submodule is therefore available. What is
native-specific is a set of caveats, not import bans:

| Caveat | Why |
|---|---|
| No per-app backend environment | a bundled module runs IN-PROCESS, so `sdk.util.shared_app_data_dir` is always `None` for it and the `PERSONALCLAW_APP_*` vars `backend_runtime` injects don't exist |
| No own dependencies | the manifest `dependencies` block installs into an app venv, which an in-process module never gets — a bundled module may use only core's own dependencies |
| Packaged assets by path are OK | a bundled app ships in the same distribution, so reading a packaged sibling (e.g. `static/dist/ui-docs.json`) by path is legitimate; **importing** a core module is not |
| Blocking work goes off-loop | it shares the gateway's event loop; use `asyncio.to_thread` as core does |

**Loading.** `providers/loader.py` resolves the module by ONE rule for both tiers: if the
`implementation` module path resolves to a file inside the app's own directory, it is
loaded from there under a namespaced `sys.modules` name
(`_pclaw_app_<name>__<module>`, `native_contract.namespaced_module_name`); otherwise it is
imported as a dotted package path. The namespacing is load-bearing — two apps commonly
ship the same bare `provider.py`, and a plain `import provider` would let the first one
win while the second silently mis-loaded. It is cached, so the availability probe and the
factory never re-execute app code (a re-exec would mint a second class for one provider,
breaking `isinstance` across two reads). The cache is for one version: a step that changes the
app's files unloads it first ([Unload and load](#unload-and-load-appsapp_runtimepy)), so the
next load runs what is on disk.

**Enforcement.** `native_contract.contract_violations` is the lint;
`tests/test_native_capability_contract.py` runs it over every bundled module and carries
the vacuity floor (at least one bundled app must actually ship a module) plus the
"no core implementation" property: no core module may reference a bundle-owned module.
That rail never skips, unlike its installed-app twin
(`tests/test_apps_import_boundary.py`), which skips whenever the workspace `apps/` dir is
absent.

**Reference implementation:** `apps/native/personalclaw-ui-docs/` — the design-system docs
tools (`ui_search` / `ui_get` / `ui_list`). Its provider left `tool_providers/ui_docs.py`
entirely (no factory remains in `tool_providers/registry.py`), and `ui_list` was then added
inside the bundle with no edit to any core module that implements, resolves or dispatches
it. One residual core touch remains for a bundled app that adds an agent **tool**: a new
tool name needs a `manifest_meta.TOOL_META` entry, because that map is the hand-maintained
input to the agent manifest and `tests/test_api_manifest_drift.py` fails on a tool without
one. That is catalogue data about the shipped distribution's agent surface, not provider
implementation — but it does mean "no core edits" is exact for provider behaviour and not
yet exact for tool *metadata*.

**The second bundle that owns code: `apps/native/ollama-models/`** — the local Ollama model
provider, bundled under an owner ruling (2026-09-21) so that a fresh install has a chat
**and** embedding provider without a credential and without cloning a second repository. It
is the contract's first non-`tool` user, and it demonstrates the two things the exemplar
could not:

- **A `model` provider needs no core edit at all**, not even the residual metadata one. It
  registers its own type at module import —
  `get_default_registry().register_type(...)`, reached through the published
  `personalclaw.sdk.model` re-export — and core's generic `ModelTypeHandler` does the rest.
  There is no `llm/*.py` self-register and no registry special case; `TOOL_META` is a
  tool-surface map, so a model bundle never touches it.
- **"Only core's own dependencies" is a hard constraint, not a preference.**
  `seed_builtin_apps()` never calls `_install_python_deps()` (only `install()` and
  `update()` do), so a bundled app that declares a dependency gets a tile that is dead on
  arrival with nothing logged. `ollama-models` was chosen precisely because its two
  third-party imports, `httpx` and `aiohttp`, are already core runtime dependencies.
  `tests/test_native_ollama_bundle.py` rails both halves across **every** bundle.

Note also that the packaged files of a bundled app are re-synced into an existing install on
every boot (`app_manager._resync_native_bundle`), not just its `app.json`: seeding is
once-only and a native app is locked against the `POST /api/apps/{name}/update` push path,
so without that resync a provider fix shipped in a new wheel would reach a fresh home and
never an upgraded one. `data/` and `installed.json` are never touched.

## Crons

Manifest-declared crons are reconciled by `apps/app_crons.py` on every
lifecycle transition (install/enable/disable/uninstall) and always register
`silent=True`: app crons are headless — no owner-DM or dashboard notification
on their runs (honored on failure too). The manifest `silent` field is
advisory and converged to true. See
[tasks-triggers.md](tasks-triggers.md#app-manifest-crons).

## MCP bridge

An app may ship its **own MCP server(s)** under `manifest.mcpServers`
(distinct from MCP servers it merely depends on). `apps/mcp_bridge.py` writes
them into the live MCP store (`~/.personalclaw/mcp.json`) on enable/install
and removes them on disable/uninstall, closing their live connections too: an update keeps the
same command and arguments, so a connection left open would keep the old server process
answering. Entries are namespaced
`{app}:{server}` so apps can't collide on a server key and deregistration
removes exactly this app's servers. App-shipped stdio servers run with
`cwd=<app dir>` (`mcp_client.py` / `mcp_discovery.py`).

The manifest is the only way an app gets an MCP server. `/api/mcp` is owner-only for
app tokens, reads included (`apps/permissions.OWNER_ONLY_API_PATHS`): a server entry is a
command the gateway launches as the owner, with the gateway's environment, and a remote
server's headers carry its bearer token. So the servers an app runs through the gateway are
the ones install (or update) consent listed from `disclosure.describe`, and an installed app
cannot add another through the API. Its own code still can, by editing `mcp.json` as you
([security/limitations.md §7](../security/limitations.md#7-an-apps-own-code-runs-as-you)).

## Declared quality bar (`apps/quality.py`)

An app may declare `quality` — `{tested, designSystem, a11y}` — which the Store
renders as the card's badge row (`web/src/pages/apps/qualityBadges.tsx`). Each
axis is **tri-state, and that is the contract**:

| value | meaning | rendering | verified? |
|---|---|---|---|
| absent | claims nothing | no badge at all | nothing to verify |
| `false` / `"legacy"` / `"n/a"` | an honest miss | a muted MISS badge | nothing to verify |
| `true` / `"v2"` | a claim | a MET badge | yes, for first-party |

Absent and declared-false are **different facts**. Collapsing them either way is
a lie: rendering absent as a pass is the obvious one; rendering it as a miss shows
an app failing a bar it never entered. `QualityDeclaration` keeps the distinction
at the parse boundary and emits only declared axes on the wire.

For a **first-party** app the block is not just decoration — the apps-repo CI runs
`python -m personalclaw.apps.quality .` and exits non-zero when a claim outruns the
evidence in the bundle:

- **`tested: true`** — the bundle ships `test_*.py` (root or `tests/`) *and* they
  pass. Presence alone is not evidence, or an empty `tests/` would buy the badge.
- **`designSystem: "v2"`** — every `*.ts`/`*.tsx` in the bundle passes token-lint,
  by the SAME rule the host frontend is held to. The patterns are shared data
  (`apps/token_lint_rules.json`), read by both `apps/quality.py` and
  `web/src/design/tokenLintRule.ts`; `tokenLintRuleParity.test.ts` fails if the two
  drift. A second implementation of the rule would be the same declared-vs-actual
  drift one layer down.
- **`a11y: true`** — the bundle ships `a11y/axe-report.json`
  (`{"appVersion", "tool", "violations": []}`) whose `appVersion` matches the
  manifest's, so a clean scan of the previous release cannot launder this one. axe
  needs a browser the apps-repo CI has none of, so the app produces the artifact and
  CI checks it.

A claim with **nothing to check** is a violation, not a free pass: `"v2"` with no
frontend to lint and `a11y: true` with no report would both badge a check that never
ran. The CLI also exits non-zero on a tree containing no `*/app.json` at all — a
checker that silently checked nothing is the failure mode this whole surface exists
to prevent.

Third-party declarations are unverified by construction, which is why the badge
tooltip says *declares*, never *verified*.

## Extension registration

`providers/loader.py` loads each enabled app, puts the app directory on
`sys.path` only while its module executes (so a later bare import can't pick up an app's
module by accident — the app's own module is registered under a namespaced
`sys.modules` name instead), and registers every contribution through
its typed `ToolTypeHandler` — model providers, transports, search providers,
inbox sources, actions, prompts, skills. Provider REST surfaces live in
`providers/routes.py` / `entity_routes.py` / `instance_routes.py`.

A tool provider is registered under its app's name, and every tool it lists passes the tool
seam before a model request carries it: a schema outside the portable profile is repaired or
left out, with one log line naming the app and the tool — see
[tool-schema-wire.md](tool-schema-wire.md).

**Availability is measured out of process.** A provider module may export
`availability() -> (bool, str)` — "can this provider run on this machine?". The gateway never
calls it: `providers/availability.py` runs every hook in a child process
(`personalclaw availability-probe <app>…`, killed at a 180 s deadline) at boot, when a
15-minute-old answer is read, and when the user presses **Check again**
(`POST /api/providers/{name}/availability`). `GET /api/providers` only reads the cached answer,
`availability: {state: checking | available | unavailable | unknown, reason, checkedAt}`.
Measured before this existed: one hook imported torch, and the list and `/api/healthz` both
passed 120 s. A hook must still be cheap — answer from metadata, never import the library it
checks for; the rule and the check to build it from are `personalclaw.sdk.availability`.
