"""Doctor — the tiered, read-only health-probe framework (PLATFORM-RESILIENCE §1).

Readiness is NOT boolean. Every diagnosis names the tier that failed:

    tier 0  process    — gateway alive; app-backend subprocesses alive (watchdog)
    tier 1  socket     — the gateway port is listening
    tier 2  cheap RPC  — the system-presence probe (status snapshot) succeeds
    tier 3  capability — per-capability probe packs (memory / channels /
                         local-models / apps / serving-fs / model-providers)

:func:`run_doctor` executes the tiers in order and **short-circuits downward**: a
tier-2 failure does not run tier-3 packs against a dead gateway — it reports a
core failure at tier 2. Probes are **read-only by contract** — an exception
becomes an ``ok=False`` result, never a 500 — and secrets are masked in
``detail``/``evidence`` before they leave a probe.

The doctrine (§1.3), enforced as tests: a tier-3 capability failure degrades ONLY
that capability's row. It never marks the gateway unhealthy and never justifies a
restart — restart is justified only when the tier-2 cheap-RPC probe itself fails.

This module owns the framework and the probe packs, and every probe is read-only. A failed
probe names its repair (``fix_id``, a confirm-gated fix in :mod:`~personalclaw.resilience.fixes`)
or says plainly it has none (``remedy``). Failed capability checks are ALSO the remediation
engine's input: :func:`failed_checks` is what `remediation.measure_deficits` reads, so the
Maintenance health score cannot read 100 while this page shows a failure — one authority.

    """durability — is every path under the home claimed by the state manifest? (S179)

    🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. `durability.inventory.audit_home()` is the claims-everything guard — the
    thing that "keeps the manifest honest … which is precisely how nine directories silently escaped
    backup before the inventory existed". It had **no runtime caller**: the only invocations were in
    `test_durability_inventory.py`, against a hand-built eight-path fixture. A store added after the
    manifest was written therefore could not fail it.

    Pointed at a REAL home for the first time it reported **10 unclaimed paths and 5482 undeclared
    databases**, including `learning.db` (the learning staging log and usage counters, 135 KB of
    live
    state) — verified absent from a real archive. A guard that only ever runs against its own
    fixture
    is testing the fixture.

    So the Doctor runs it on the actual home. Read-only: `audit_home` only stats and globs. A gap
    FAILS this tier-3 check, which degrades the durability card and nothing else — unclaimed state
    is a backup-coverage gap the user should see and act on, never a reason to call the install
    broken. There is no automatic fix (claiming a path is a change to the manifest, which ships
    with a release), so the row says that and what to do meanwhile.

      phone on the same tailnet reaches ``http://<tailnet-ip>:<port>`` over the
      tailnet's own encryption. Evidence carries that phone-usable BASE url; the

      NEVER mints or prints a live token — a read-only health check must not
      generate a secret, and evidence strings are redacted anyway.

      off (``AuthMode.NONE`` / ``PERSONALCLAW_DEV_NO_AUTH``). That is the one
      genuine misconfiguration: anything that reaches the interface walks in.
      (``effective_bind`` forces NONE to loopback, so this only arises when

    # block. Whether that admission behaviour *should* change is an owner fork
    # (product-roadmap:structural_block:security-control-fork-…), not this probe's call —
    # so the probe makes the hazard VISIBLE and stops there.
    #
    # Why the COMBINATION is the hazard when neither half alone is. With the bypass armed
    # the middleware grants token-free access to any request whose resolved client address
    # is private (`is_private_network(_resolved_client_ip(request))`, token_auth.py:943-946).
    # That is defensible on a home LAN, where "private address" really does mean "someone in
    # my house". Behind a reverse proxy it stops meaning that: the address the middleware
    # resolves is the PROXY's — 127.0.0.1 for a local tunnel daemon, 172.18.x.x on a compose
    # bridge — and both are private. So every request the proxy forwards, from anywhere on
    # the internet, is admitted without a token. Declaring `trusted_proxies` or `public_url`
    # is precisely the operator saying "my traffic arrives through a proxy", which is what
    # makes the pair reportable while either half alone is not.
    #
    # MIRRORED, not re-derived (cli_doctor.py:344-349 asks for this, #2860): both facts come
    # from `dashboard/origin` — the module that already mirrors the middleware's short-circuits
    # for `loopback_requires_token` — the bypass via `local_network_bypass_enabled()` and the
    # config side via `declared_proxy_front()`, which reads `dashboard/exposure`, the single
    # module that owns the exposure signal. This row spells neither the env var nor the config
    # keys itself, so it cannot drift from the behaviour it reports on. Going through `origin`
    # rather than importing `exposure` here is also what keeps `structural-import-direction`
    # honest: core must not import the HTTP surface, `origin` is doctor's ONE grandfathered
    # `dashboard` edge, and `dashboard` importing itself is exempt by construction.
    #
    # Placed before the tailnet branch because a tailnet does not make the bypass safe behind
    # a proxy, and after the auth-OFF branch so that broader, already-shipped case keeps its
    # own message. Guarded on the bypass FIRST: not armed ⇒ no config is read and this row is

    the interpreter's SQLite was built, so on some installs the index cannot load and search

    """knowledge — which ingested items can search NOT fully reach? (RET-2, RET-4)

    🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. Measured before RET-2: an image-only PDF and a document ingested
    with no embedding provider both persisted ``processing_status='done'`` while part of
    retrieval could not see either — the AnythingLLM #6143 shape, where the app reports
    success and RAG returns no sources. The ingest runner now persists ``unsearchable`` + a
    typed reason instead; this is the surface that makes those items VISIBLE rather than a
    status value in a table nobody opens.

    🔴 AND WHAT IT MAY CLAIM ABOUT THEM. This row used to say "they are in the library and no
    query can reach them" — measured false in live validation, where keyword search found
    both notes in the library and through ``knowledge_search`` (whose note printed the same
    claim, then listed the match). Three of the four reasons remove only SEMANTIC reach. The
    sentence is therefore :attr:`~personalclaw.knowledge.searchability.Degradation.summary`,
    the one the search tool prints too; this probe composes no claim of its own.

    **Reports failed, not degraded**, and that is the deliberate half. Doctor's other
    knowledge probes report degraded because a slower-but-correct search is not an outage.
    An item half of search cannot see is a gap the user must act on (bind an embedder, add
    a text version, re-ingest), which is exactly what ``ok=False`` is for. Per §1.3 it still
    degrades only this capability: it never marks the gateway unhealthy and never justifies
    a restart.

    **One row per item, counted the way the library counts.** ``items`` carries a row per
    LIBRARY item, so the surface names WHICH document is affected and the number matches the
    list a user can check it against. Rows the library deliberately never lists — an
    artifact's search mirror, a report's finding — go under ``unlisted_items`` and are named
    apart in the sentence ("2 items and 1 artifact"), never folded into "items". Read-only
    throughout: ``knowledge.db`` is opened ``mode=ro`` with ``create=False``, so a health
    check on an install that has never used knowledge creates nothing.

    **RET-4 folds in one more gap**: an item whose PASSAGE vectors came from a different
    embedding model than the one bound now (``stale_index``). Keyword search still reaches
    it and semantic search skips it, the same user-visible shape as a missing embedding, so
    it belongs in this row rather than in a second probe a user has to correlate. Its remedy
    is different and the row says so: a re-index, not a re-ingest.

    """sandbox — does the cgroup v2 pids/RSS enforcement tier exist on THIS host?

    The NOFILE floor is a per-process rlimit and applies everywhere. The pids and RSS
    ceilings are only enforceable as a transient ``systemd-run --user --scope`` over a
    unified cgroup v2 hierarchy, so on macOS, a non-systemd Linux, or a container without a
    systemd user session they are simply not enforced. This row says that in plain words
    rather than simulating a bound that does not exist.

    **The ok=True vs ok=False call.** Unavailability is not a gateway failure — this is a
    tier-3 CAPABILITY probe, so a red here degrades only the sandbox row and never justifies
    a restart. The split is therefore by CONSEQUENCE, not by platform:

    * tier available → ``ok=True``; ``evidence.enforced`` names what is actually bounded.
    * tier unavailable and NO pids/RSS ceiling configured → ``ok=True``. A permanent red on
      every Mac trains operators to ignore the doctor, and nothing is being silently
      dropped: both ceilings are off (0). The ``detail`` still names what is unenforced, so
      the fact is on the row rather than hidden behind a green.
    * tier unavailable while a ceiling IS configured → ``ok=False``. Here a green would hide
      two configured controls that cannot do what the operator asked of them, which is
      exactly the dishonesty this probe exists to prevent.

    The availability decision itself is ``sandbox.probe_cgroup_scopes()`` — the same cached
    function the spawn path consults — so the doctor can never report a tier the spawn path
    does not actually use. A second copy of the detection here would drift from enforcement.

    Precision note for the wording: where the tier is missing the shim may still set
    ``RLIMIT_NPROC``/``RLIMIT_AS`` when configured, but those are a per-USER process count
    and an address-space cap, not a per-subtree pids/RSS bound — hence "not enforced".

    Never raises: a missing ``/sys/fs/cgroup``, an absent ``systemd-run``, an unreadable
    file, or a permission error all degrade to unavailable with the cause recorded in
    ``evidence.availability_detail``. Degrading toward "not enforced" is the honest
    direction — a probe that cannot prove enforcement must not claim it. The probe only
    REPORTS; the single loud warning belongs to the sandbox module, so re-running the doctor
    can never multiply it.

        being ignored. Reporting the RESOLVED zone and not the requested one is the same rule

    A correctly resolved zone is `ok=True` and still reports the zone and where it came from,

    POSIX-only and absent on native Windows — where it is missing, both degrade silently
    to a no-op. This probe surfaces that platform fact rather than leaving it invisible.

    **The ok=True call.** Absence is a platform CAPABILITY fact, not a gateway failure: a
    permanent red on every Windows host would train operators to ignore the doctor (the same
    reasoning the cgroup-scopes probe follows), and nothing is being *silently* dropped once
    the row states it. So both states are ``ok=True`` at tier 3; the ``detail`` carries the
    consequence loudly when the facility is missing. The decision is the SAME guarded helper
    the gateway and shim consult (``resource_limits_available``), so this can never claim a
