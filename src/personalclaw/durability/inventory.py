"""The state inventory — one manifest of everything that matters (§1).

Every durability mechanism (snapshot, export, and later shard/sync/drills) reads
THIS instead of carrying its own allowlist. That is the whole point: the previous
design had `snapshot.CORE_FILES` and `portability.EXPORT_EXCLUDE` maintained by
hand, and they had already drifted — nine real store directories were covered by
neither. A declarative manifest plus :func:`audit_home` (which fails on any
unclaimed path) makes that class of bug impossible to reintroduce silently.

Each entry declares four things that matter to a backup:

* **kind** — how to read/write it safely. ``sqlite`` in particular must never be
  raw-copied while the gateway holds it open; see :func:`sqlite_entries`.
* **domain** — the user-facing grouping. Snapshot components are exactly the
  domains, so ``VALID_COMPONENTS`` is derived, never typed twice.
* **secret** — never leaves this machine, in any export or sync.
* **credential** — a secret whose content IS credential values (API keys, tokens, the
  session-signing key). Never captured by a snapshot either: a snapshot is a file that gets
  copied to a USB stick or a cloud drive, and a plaintext key inside one is a leaked key.
  Settings files carry ``{{secret:…}}`` references instead (``config.secret_refs``), so a
  restore onto this machine resolves them; a restore onto a wiped one asks for the keys again.
* **derived** — an index/cache rebuilt from authoritative state. Excluded from
  shards and exports; restoring it is at best wasted bytes and at worst a
  corrupt index paired with a newer store.

``merge`` and ``tombstones`` are declared here but consumed by later sessions
(restore --mode merge, shard sync); they are part of the entry's identity, so
they belong in the manifest rather than being bolted on later.

    # holds hidden validation answer keys that are "never rendered into any worker session's

    # longest way round to exactly that. Now that `evals/studies/<id>/locked/` has a writer
    # (`evals/store.write_locked_check`), the control has something to protect.

    # `derived_within` is the field with a live reader on BOTH paths that copy this tree
    # (`portability.py:_is_derived_within` and `snapshot.py:_derived_within`), so declaring

    # snapshot half is a deliberate consequence, not an oversight: an answer key belongs on
    # one machine, and the cost — a REGISTERED-but-unrun study restored from a snapshot has
    # lost its checks — is caught loudly rather than silently, because `studies.run_study`
    # REFUSES a study whose registration declares checks it cannot load.
    #
    # §7/ES-10 adds `benchmarks/bakeoff` for the same reason and by the same mechanism: it
    # holds redacted excerpts of the user's OWN traffic, captured only while an off-by-
    # default flag is on. Those excerpts are scored once and expire, so the export/snapshot
    # cost of dropping them is nil (re-enable capture to refill), while carrying a redacted
    # slice of real inputs off the machine is a leak the flag's own privacy posture forbids.
