"""`{{secret:KEY}}` in a trigger's action config (§7 item 6 / decision 11 — S115).

**🔴 THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES.** Workflows have carried `{{secret:KEY}}` since WF2-R14 — the validator
rejects an inline credential and tells the author to use that form, and three separate surfaces say
so in their error text. A TRIGGER action did not resolve it. Driven before writing a line:

    bash action, command "echo tok={{secret:MY_KEY}}"
      → stdout: tok={{secret:MY_KEY}}        # the literal placeholder reached the shell

So a user following the documented pattern got a broken command, and the only way to make a trigger
authenticate was to paste the credential into `triggers.json` — a file that is world-readable in the
home, copied into every snapshot (S113 just made sure of that), and echoed into run records and the
UI. The guidance and the mechanism disagreed, and the mechanism won.

**Why this module and not `workflows/secrets.py`.** That module's resolution lives inside the
workflow engine's binding context (`BindingContext.secret_resolver`, reached through `_walk_path`
and the pipe grammar). A trigger action config is a flat `{provider, config}` dict resolved at
dispatch with no binding tree, so reusing it would mean building a fake context around two lines of
string substitution. What IS shared is the thing that matters: both resolve against the same
`CredentialStore`, so a key means one thing across the whole product.

**The disciplines, and why each one is here:**

* **Resolution is at DISPATCH, never at save.** The stored config keeps the placeholder, so the
  secret is not in `triggers.json`, not in a snapshot, and not in the run record.
* **An unresolved key is an ERROR, not an empty string.** Substituting "" would run
  `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer "` — a request that fails somewhere remote with a 401 the user
  cannot trace back to a missing credential. Refusing names the key.
* **Resolved values NEVER travel back.** The resolved dict is handed to the provider and dropped;
  nothing writes it, and `redact_credentials` still guards the output path.
