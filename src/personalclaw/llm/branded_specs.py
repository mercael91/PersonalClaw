"""The branded-provider spec registry and its credential ladder — CORE, not the SDK.

These live below the ``personalclaw.sdk.*`` boundary on purpose. A branded provider **app**
declares a :class:`BrandedProviderSpec` and registers it through
``sdk.provider_helpers.register_branded_app``; the registry it lands in, and the
credential-resolution order used to turn a spec into a usable secret, are **core state and
core policy**. Four core modules read them (``llm/catalog.py``, ``providers/loader.py``,
``routing/rates.py``, ``inbound/capture_proxy.py``), and before this module existed every one
of them reached UP through the app-facing facade to do it — the inversion
``structural-import-direction`` names ``core-must-not-import-its-own-published-facade``.

``sdk/provider_helpers.py`` now re-exports everything here, so an app's import path is
unchanged; the direction of the dependency is what changed. The credential ladder is defined
once, here, which is the property that matters: a hand-copied second spelling of it is what
made a subscription provider 401 at first use.

    the protocol client can still be constructed, while the catalog reports "not configured".
    ``reason`` carries the resolver's displayable, secret-free explanation when the spec
    declares a subscription source that is NOT usable ("" otherwise), so a caller can say
    "sign in with `x login` first" instead of naming an env var the app doesn't have.
