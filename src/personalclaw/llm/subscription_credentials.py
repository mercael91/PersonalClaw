"""Subscription-credential sources — a provider riding an already-signed-in CLI's login.

Some model vendors bill by SUBSCRIPTION rather than per-token API key, so there is no key
for the user to paste: they already signed that vendor's own agent CLI in on this machine,
and the CLI holds a bearer token in a credential store IT owns. A model-provider app can
declare where that store is and resolve the token from it, so the provider needs no
separate key at all.

This module is that mechanism, and nothing more. It is a *credential resolution* seam:
sessions, models and catalogs still flow through the normal branded-app path, and no agent
runtime is involved.

Three contracts hold it together:

1. **Strictly read-only.** Resolving opens the declared file, parses it, and returns. It
   never writes, creates, moves, renames, chmods, refreshes or deletes another tool's
   credential store — not even to "repair" or "renew" one. An expired token is reported as
   not-signed-in and the user re-runs their own CLI's login; PersonalClaw does not touch
   the vendor's store on their behalf. ``tests/test_subscription_credentials.py`` asserts
   this structurally (no write-shaped call exists in this module's AST) and behaviourally
   (bytes, mode and mtime are identical after a resolve).

2. **Fail soft and typed — and a parse error is never "signed in".** Every failure path
   returns a :class:`SubscriptionAuth` with ``logged_in=False`` and a human ``reason``;
   nothing raises and nothing returns a partial secret. A missing file, an unreadable
   file, a *malformed or half-written* file, a missing/blank/non-string token and an
   expired token all land in the same not-signed-in outcome. That symmetry is the point:
   a truncated write must not read as authenticated.

3. **No secret is ever emitted.** ``reason`` strings are built from the source id, the
   declared path and the app's own login hint — never from file content, and never from
   the token. :class:`SubscriptionAuth` keeps ``secret`` out of its ``repr``, so logging
   or formatting a result cannot leak it. For a malformed store we deliberately report a
   fixed sentence instead of the parser's exception text, so no fragment of the file can
   ride out inside an error message.

**Core ships no vendor rows.** A :class:`SubscriptionSource` is *declared by the app* and
registered at app import time, exactly like the provider type and catalog it ships beside
(see ``sdk/provider_helpers.py``). Core knows how to read a declared store; it does not
know that any particular CLI exists, where it keeps its token, or what its login verb is
called — the app names its own login verb in ``login_hint``, the same discipline the ACP
readiness probe follows with ``login_command``.

A subscription model-provider app therefore declares two things and is done::

    from personalclaw.sdk.provider_helpers import (
        BrandedProviderSpec,
        SubscriptionSource,
        register_branded_app,
        register_subscription_source,
    )

    register_subscription_source(
        SubscriptionSource(
            id="example-cli",
            login_hint="sign in with `example login` first",
            credential_files=("~/.example/.credentials.json",),
            token_path=("oauth", "accessToken"),
            expires_at_path=("oauth", "expiresAt"),
            expires_at_unit="ms",
        )
    )

    _factory, create_provider, create_catalog = register_branded_app(
        BrandedProviderSpec(
            type="example-subscription",
            protocol="anthropic",
            default_base_url="https://api.example.invalid",
            credential_source="example-cli",  # NO api_key_env — there is no key
            default_model="example-large",
        )
    )

The app needs no ``availability()`` hook: ``providers/loader.py`` derives one from the
declared ``credential_source``, so a not-signed-in source greys the bundle out in the
extensions list with the app's own reason.
