"""Provider registry: maps types to factories and named entries to instances.

Holds two pieces of state:

1. A mapping from provider *type* (``"openai"``, ``"anthropic"``, ``"acp_agent"``,
   ...) to a ``(ProviderCapability, ProviderFactory)`` pair, registered at
   import time by the concrete provider modules.
2. A mapping from configured Provider_Entry *name* to the corresponding
   :class:`ProviderEntry` instance, registered after config load.

The registry validates two invariants at registration time:

* The entry's ``type`` is a known type (Requirement R1.3).
* The entry's ``declared_capabilities`` are a subset of the type's
  registered capability set (Requirement R1.4).

It does NOT instantiate providers eagerly; :meth:`ProviderRegistry.build`
invokes the registered factory on demand. This module is loaded as a side
effect of importing :mod:`personalclaw.providers` and MUST NOT import any
provider SDK (``anthropic``, ``openai``, ``httpx``); Property 11
(Provider SDK Lazy Import) depends on this guarantee.

    The fixture module is imported LAZILY — as every provider construction this
    module reaches for is — so ``import personalclaw.llm.registry`` never depends
    on it and the import only happens on a path the opt-in already gated (this
    module must not import a provider at all; see the module docstring's
    Property 11 note).

    The fixture takes **no** constructor arguments — deliberately, because a
    ``script_path`` kwarg would be a hole in its env gate, and its own test pins
    ``inspect.signature`` to exactly ``["self"]``. So ``entry.model`` and any
    per-turn ``model`` override stay descriptive here: the reply text comes from
    the script file the opt-in names, not from a model id. Reading them anyway
    would imply a choice the fixture does not make.

    is strict about duplicates by design, so the repeat-call tolerance belongs

    The entry carries ``credential=None`` — the whole point of a fixture that runs
    with no credentials present. That exemption is a LITERAL on this one entry and
    is scoped to this type alone: no other type reaches it, and every
    config-derived entry below keeps its own ``credential`` verbatim, so a real
    provider still refuses to build without one.
