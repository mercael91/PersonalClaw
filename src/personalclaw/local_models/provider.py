"""The local-model management contract — descriptor + provider ABC.

A provider that owns local downloadable models implements this so core can list,
download, and delete them uniformly, and surface them for use-case binding. It is the

TtsProvider, …) for the *inference* axis. The two are orthogonal by design: management
is identical across use-cases, inference is not.
