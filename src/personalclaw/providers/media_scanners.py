"""Media-capability config scanners — an app-owned extension point.

The typed media registries (image_gen, video_gen, stt, tts, embedding) build a
per-capability ADAPTER for each configured model provider so one config.json
entry serves every use-case that provider supports. Core knows the OpenAI-family
built-in; any OTHER provider (Bedrock, …) contributes its adapters here WITHOUT
core needing to know the provider — the app registers a scanner on import.

A scanner for capability ``cap`` is a callable that takes the list of
config.json provider entries (``[{name, type, options}, …]``) and returns the
provider adapters it wants registered for that capability. It should return only
adapters for entries whose ``type`` it owns, and is called every time a registry
(re)builds — so it must be cheap + idempotent (return fresh adapter objects;
the registry dedupes by ``provider.name``).

This keeps core provider-agnostic: Bedrock's image/video/stt/embedding logic
lives entirely in the bedrock-models app, which calls ``register_scanner`` at
import for each capability it serves.
