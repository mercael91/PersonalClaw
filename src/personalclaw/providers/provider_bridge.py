"""Provider Bridge — resolves a use case to a live ModelProvider instance.

The model is:

1. Read the active selection for the use case from ``active_models.json``
   (Settings → Models) — a ``"<provider_name>:<model_id>"`` ref.
2. Resolve that provider from the config.json ``providers[]`` registry
   (``default_registry``), pinning to the selected model.
3. Fall back to the first configured provider declaring the capability when no
   model is selected.

The bridge exports a single function ``create_provider_factory()`` that returns
a callable matching the factory signature::

    workflow stage's subagent on a project-less run, a background session — therefore read and

    unattended: its worker wrote ``checklist.md`` into the repository checkout the gateway was
    launched from, while the run page said it had looked in the run's own directory. For a gateway
    started from the home directory that is ``~``; for a service manager it can be ``/``. Either
    way the loop's result lands somewhere the user cannot find, which is the family the ACP spawn
    path already refuses (``session._acp_spawn_cwd``).

    So a native session defaults to the same place an ACP one does: the configured workspace root
    (``default_workspace_dir()`` — validated to exist and not to be a sensitive path), which is
    also where a new chat, the Terminal and the Files page open. When no safe workspace resolves,

    app isn't installed or configured)"* — including for causes where ``config.json``
    plainly contains the entry. A missing type factory was reported as a missing app, and
    the fix told the user to install their own provider ENTRY name in the App Store, which
    is not a thing that exists there (#3408).

    Each branch below asks a question the next one is allowed to assume, so the answer
    names the cause that actually fired:

    1. ``config.json`` unreadable — say so rather than guess either way.
    2. no entry by that name in config.json — the original sentence, now only when true.
    3. in config.json but not in the live registry — the boot/sync gap.
    4. its ``type`` has no registered factory — app not installed, or installed but
       DISABLED, which are different fixes and are distinguished here. Names the **type**,
       because that is the token the Store and ``POST /api/providers`` speak; the entry
       name is the user's own label and matches nothing installable.
    5. entry + factory present, but its declared capabilities do not cover the use case.
    6. the credential it names has no secret in the credential store.
    7. anything left — which it states as *unsure*, with the model id to check and the log
       line to read, rather than asserting a specific wrong cause.

    "The model name is not offered by that provider" is deliberately NOT a branch:
    resolution passes ``model_override`` through to the factory unvalidated, so a wrong
    model id does not make this function return ``None``. When a factory rejects it, the
    build failure lands in branch 7, which is why that branch names the model id.
