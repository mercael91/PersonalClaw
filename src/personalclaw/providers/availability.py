"""Provider availability — measured in a child process, served from memory, never on a request.

A provider app may export ``availability() -> (bool, str)``: "can this provider run on THIS
machine?". Settings → Providers shows the answer on every card. The list route used to call
every hook synchronously on the event loop, on every request, and a hook is app code with
unbounded cost. Measured cold in the container: sentence-transformers' hook (it imported
torch) 171.8 s, kiro-cli's 6.8 s, gemini-cli's 5.2 s. ``/api/providers`` and a concurrent
``/api/healthz`` both exceeded 120 s, and the container health check recorded 161 s — long
enough for an orchestrator to restart the gateway.

Moving the call onto a worker thread is not enough, and that was measured too: a thread that
imports sentence-transformers still stalled the loop for 3.8 s (faster-whisper: 4.4 s) —
a C-extension import holds the GIL for seconds at a time — and the library then stays
resident in the gateway (about a gigabyte for torch) to answer one boolean. A thread that
runs past its timeout also can never be stopped.

So the hooks run in a child process, ``personalclaw availability-probe <app>…``, which the
gateway reads line by line and kills at :data:`PROBE_DEADLINE_SECS`:

* the list route only READS this board; an app that was never measured reads ``checking``;
* an answer is served for :data:`AVAILABILITY_TTL_SECS`, after which a read re-measures in
  the background while the previous answer keeps being served;
* ``POST /api/providers/{name}/availability`` re-measures one app now — the facts a hook
  reads change when the user installs a package or signs a CLI in, which is exactly when
  they press the card's "Check again";
* the gateway warms the board once at boot, so a card is rarely seen in ``checking``.

The child is given the gateway's resolved home explicitly (``PERSONALCLAW_HOME``). It must
answer for the home this gateway serves, and a child left to resolve its own would read
whatever an unset variable defaults to — in a test process that is the developer's real home.
