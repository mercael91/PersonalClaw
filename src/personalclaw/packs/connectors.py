"""Connector catalog + requirements resolution (AGENT-PACKS §3.3, AP-3).

A pack declares the MCP connectors its skills/templates expect — never their credentials
(§2.2: a ``connectors.json`` entry is schema-banned from carrying a value-bearing field).
On import, each declaration must be RESOLVED against this machine, three ways:

* **configure** — the declared connector is known (in the seeded catalog or self-contained):
  collect the required credential, store it in the credential store under its own name (the
  one Settings → Secrets lists), and write the MCP server through
  :mod:`providers.mcp_instances` (the existing multi-instance seam with its injectable-key
  guard). A credential NEVER lands in the pack or a plaintext config
  field — it goes to the credential store, keyed by name, and the server spec references it
  by env-var name only.
* **substitute** — the user points the requirement at a DIFFERENT catalog entry of the SAME
  ``category`` (their own search MCP instead of the author's). No new server is written; the
  substitute already exists locally, and the connector reference resolves to it.
* **skip** — the requirement is recorded UNMET. Dependent components still install; the pack
  degrades with a machine-readable marker (:data:`MISSING_PREFIX` + name) the pack detail
  page reads to show which connector-dependent parts are unavailable — the degraded-
  completion idiom (a skipped dep is not a crash).

The connector catalog itself is ``<home>/connector_catalog.json`` (§9), seeded with a small
bundled starter set on first read and user-extendable. There is no remote refresh: the
``packs.connector_catalog_url`` config leaf this docstring once deferred to "a later atom"
was read by nothing — not even here — while shipping an allowlisted PATCH path and a Settings
control, so it was deleted rather than left promising (issue #3490).

Fail closed: an unknown resolution mode, a configure with no credential value, or a
substitute to a different-category entry all refuse rather than write a half-configured
server.
