"""The run controller — one conductor per run, and the only writer of run state.

Everything about this module follows from one rule: **a run has exactly one writer**
(WF2-R10). The tick loop under `self._lock` is it. Nothing else — not a dispatcher, not
a watchdog, not an HTTP handler — writes a terminal status. Handlers request; the loop
decides and writes.

That rule is what makes the harder features tractable later. Mid-flight mutation (Slice
4) can only be safe if there is a well-defined moment when no node is being scheduled;
here that moment is "between scheduling steps, holding the lock". Crash recovery can only
be correct if terminal writes are serialized, or a resumed run and a still-dying task
race to disagree about the outcome.

The loop is deliberately boring:

    while not terminal:
        drain cancel intent
        compute frontier (pure)
        launch admitted work
        await *something* finishing
        apply results, persist state

`asyncio.wait(FIRST_COMPLETED)` is what keeps it responsive without polling: a fast
transform does not wait behind a ten-minute stage. `WAITING` nodes hold no lane and are
woken by deadline, so a run parked on an approval for six hours costs nothing.

**Budget pre-charge (WF2-R4 invariant).** A resumed run inherits spend from its ledger
before scheduling anything. Minting a fresh budget on resume would turn a crash loop into
unbounded spend — the exact failure the cap exists to prevent.

        `workspace:` block was parsed nowhere, so every run ran in place no matter what its
        template declared — the whole §4.1 mechanism was a decision layer with no call site.

        **A FATAL declaration REFUSES the run.** `parse_workspace` marks an unknown mode and a
        greedy preserve pattern fatal precisely because they cannot be honored, and honoring
        neither means running in a mode nobody chose. An ignored fatal issue is the inert-control
        shape this program keeps finding, so it terminates the run through `_finish` (the single
        terminal writer) instead of degrading quietly.

        **The lock is taken and RELEASED here, not held for the run.** Holding a flock across a
        multi-hour run would tie the workspace to this process's lifetime, so a gateway restart
        would strand it. What the lock actually protects is the provisioning WINDOW — the
        preserve+setup pass, where two processes writing the same tree corrupt each other. Live
        contention refuses the run rather than queueing: two runs interleaving writes in one
        worktree is worse than telling the second one now.

        Idempotent, because `_prepare` runs again on resume: `add_worktree` returns the same path
        for an existing run id (measured), setup is marker-guarded and content-addressed, and
        preserve is an overwriting copy. The second pass is therefore cheap and safe rather than a
        second workspace.

        Guarded on everything except the deliberate refusal: a provisioning bug must cost the
        isolation, never the run — a run that cannot start because a scratch dir failed to `mkdir`
        would be strictly worse than one that runs in the project workspace and says so.

        The run already carries the inherited mode in `extra` (stamped by `start_run`); this is the
        moment it becomes ENFORCED in the process-global `session_restrictions` registry — the fast
        path the knowledge/learning writers consult during the run. The chat layer never marks the
        registry (it enforces off `session.is_restricted` on the LIVE session object, which a
        background run no longer holds), so this is the registry's FIRST writer for a run's keys.

        The mark is made for BOTH the launching session key AND the run-owned key: the origin key is
        what the run-end LearningGate reads (`_capture_run_end` keys `for_session` off
        `origin.session_key`), and the owned key is what any run-scoped write would carry. A
        `temporary` run gets both marks per `restriction_calls`, because `is_temporary` gates reads
        while `is_restricted` gates writes.

        **Durability lives in `run.extra`, not a session JSONL.** A run owns no `ConversationLog`
        file — stage subagents persist under their own `subagent:<id>` keys, and the `workflow:`
        owned string is a provenance ref, not a JSONL key. The run record's `extra["memory_mode"]`
        IS the run's durable metadata head: `start_run` stamps it via `ownership.stamp_run_mode`,
        which is `ownership.durable_metadata` (same `memory_mode` key by construction, not two
        literals). It round-trips through the run record on disk and is what a gateway restart
        replays — after which `_prepare` runs again and re-marks the registry from it, and the
        engine's node-skip + the run-end gate keep reading it. Materializing an owned-session JSONL
        line would create a file no reader consumes (the reindex path forgets restricted sessions on
        sight), so the durable write is deliberately the `extra` head. DEVIATION from the literal
        "JSONL write" phrasing, recorded in the plan's Execution log.

        Idempotent and best-effort: `_prepare` runs once per live controller and again on resume,
        and re-marking a key already in the LRU is a no-op. A NORMAL run does nothing — an
        unrestricted origin has nothing to suppress. Guarded because `_prepare` must not fail the

        re-rolls the twelve stages nobody complained about (the same argument `revision.py` makes

        sends the step back for a re-draft rather than accepting the artifact), with the engine's
        own state names: the gate instance goes back to PENDING at the current epoch, not DONE, so
        it re-asks against the revised step. It is deliberately NOT an approval — nothing is marked
        approved, no `always_allow` is remembered, and no `gate_resolved` is journaled, because the
        gate has not been answered yet.

        EVERY refusal here happens before the token is consumed. The whole point of a revise is that

        does not live in `_inflight`. Not a new knob: a second constant here would be a second

        The cost is stated plainly, because it is not symmetric with `_await_progress`: there,
        `TICK_WAKE_SECS` is only a CEILING (a finished task wakes the wait immediately), while a
        polled subagent has no such signal, so this is real settle LATENCY — up to five seconds
        per stage, measured at 5.33s for a stage whose fake finished one lookup in. Against a

        nudging the controller from the completion side, which is exactly what WF2-R10 (`_apply`
        is the only place a node reaches terminal) exists to prevent.

        Deliberately NOT folded into `_next_wake_delay`, even though that is where a deadline

        parking a gated run at NEEDS_INPUT, so teaching it about a live subagent would change

        holding both an unanswered gate and a live stage parks as NEEDS_INPUT and orphans the

        `dispatch_stage` spawns and returns RUNNING immediately (``engine.py:777``), so by the
        time that result is applied the awaited asyncio task is ALREADY done: `_await_progress`
        pops the entry out of `_inflight` (:2686) before `_apply` sees it, and the tick loop
        then takes the idle branch (:573) that never calls `_await_progress` again.
        `_enforce_stall_timeouts` is reachable only from there (:2682), so it stopped being able
        to observe the node at all; `node_timeout_total` never could, because it bounds the
        awaited dispatcher coroutine (:2539) and for a stage that coroutine ends at the spawn.
        The result was a node that stayed RUNNING with no `step_completed` after its subagent
        had reported `done: True` — which hung every template containing a `stage`.

        **`_inflight` is deliberately NOT the home for a dispatched stage.** Every consumer of
        that dict assumes `entry.task` is a live awaitable: `_await_progress` selects on it with
        FIRST_COMPLETED, and both the stall sweep and `_cancel_inflight` cancel it. Re-inserting
        an already-finished task would make `asyncio.wait` return instantly on every tick and
        re-apply the same RUNNING result forever; parking a never-resolving placeholder there
        instead would mean inventing a fake task to satisfy a signature. A spawned subagent is
        not an awaited task. What the controller legitimately owns is the ID of the work, and
        that is instance state — exactly like `wake_at`.

        **One source of truth for liveness.** "Has this subagent finished?" stays owned by
        `SubagentManager.get` (``subagent.py:1632``), the same lookup the sessions surface reads
        (``dashboard/handlers/sessions.py:388``). Nothing is registered here. That also settles
        the HUNG case without a second deadline: the manager's own reaper (``subagent.py:739``)
        force-kills a child past `_default_timeout` and records the verdict as `done=True` with
        `error="Reaped after ..."` (:791-793). That deadline already existed and was merely

        """A spawned stage's settled result, its output in the shape its own `config` DECLARES.

        This settle path is the ONLY place a `stage` output is produced — `dispatch_stage` returns
        RUNNING at the spawn — so every seam that reads a stage's declared shape has to be applied
        here or it is inert. Two were:

        * **The declared `schema`.** The output used to be `{"result": "<the subagent's raw
          text>"}` unconditionally, so a stage's declared keys reached no binding, no
          `progress_field` and no judge contract. Measured consequences on the shipped library:
          `general-project` declares `progress_field: meaningful_progress`, `_progress_value` never
          found it, `_iteration_is_dry` fell back to the whole-output rule, a non-empty
          `{"result": …}` is never dry — so `until_dry` degenerated into `max_iterations` and the
          run escalated with "the loop reached its iteration ceiling" (#3524's wrong headline).
          `{{last.output.summary}}` and `{{nodes.work.output.summary}}` could not resolve either,
          which is why closing #3524's `last` gap alone only moves the error from
          `unresolved reference at 'last'` to `unresolved reference at 'summary'`. An `infer` node
          in the same run has always been parsed (`engine.parse_json_loose` at its DONE branch) —
          that asymmetry between two node kinds reading the same templates was the whole defect.
        * **`judge_contract`.** `engine.apply_judge_contract` runs at the dispatch seam so "a node
          kind cannot skip it", and a `stage` skipped it anyway: at that seam a stage's result is
          still `RUNNING` with `{"subagent_id": …}`, which the contract declines. ALL SEVEN
          `judge_contract` nodes in the bundled library are stages, so the contract validated
          nothing, ever — the engine's recomputed `overall`, its `valid` flag and its `shortfalls`
          (which three templates bind as `{{last.output.shortfalls}}`) were never produced.
        * **The declared-schema notice (#3545).** The dispatch seam's own
          `engine.apply_schema_notice`, observing the subagent's TEXT rather than the output built
          from it. The `{"result": text}` envelope would be named as a `result` key the worker never
          wrote, and the judge contract writes every key a judge schema declares whatever the model
          said, so the settled output of a judge that answered in prose carries all of them.

        A stage that declares NO schema keeps `{"result": text}` — unstructured output is a real
        thing a stage may return, and that is its shape, not a fallback. A stage that declares one
        and returns unparseable text also keeps it: the binding then fails naming the key it wanted,
        which is what happens today, so this cannot turn a run that passes into one that fails. It
        can only ADD resolvable keys.

    * ``None`` → dry. The body answered the question with "nothing".
    * ``bool`` → ``False`` dry, ``True`` progress. A boolean field IS the answer; checked
      before ``int`` because ``bool`` is an ``int`` subclass and would otherwise be read as
      "1 finding" / "0 findings" by accident.

      says nothing is new.

    * ``list`` / ``tuple`` / ``set`` / ``frozenset`` / ``dict`` → dry iff empty. Nothing

      dry and hands the decision back to the whole-output fallback. Not swallowed as
