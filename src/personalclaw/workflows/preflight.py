"""Run-start preflight — fail before spending, not at node 7 (WF2-R12).

A workflow that needs a credential it does not have should refuse to start. The
alternative — discovering it seven nodes in — has already paid for six nodes of model
calls, and the user reads a mid-run failure as a bug rather than a missing setting.

Four checks, all cheap and none of them instantiating anything:

* **credentials** — declared in `metadata.requirements.credentials`, plus every
  `{{secret:KEY}}` the spec actually references. The declaration is what an author
  promised; the references are what the engine will really resolve, and a spec can
  reference a key nobody declared.
* **binaries** — `shutil.which`, so a template needing `git` or `gh` says so up front.
* **models** — the `can_resolve_use_case` probe, deliberately reusing the same
  no-instantiate check behind onboarding's `needs_model`. A private capability check here
  could disagree with what the bridge can actually resolve, and then preflight would pass
  a run the engine cannot execute.
* **action providers** — every `action` node's provider must be registered. An unknown
  provider is a guaranteed node failure that costs nothing to catch now.

**Missing is an ERROR; unverifiable is a WARNING.** If a check cannot run (no credential
store, no registry) preflight must not claim the requirement is absent — refusing a run
because the checker was unavailable is its own outage. That distinction is the whole
reason findings are typed rather than a bare list of strings.

`provider_requirement_gap` is the fifth thing a reader needs and the one these four checks
structurally cannot produce: what the referenced providers *themselves* require. It is a
separate function rather than a fifth check because it belongs on the PLAN surface, not on the
run-start gate — see its docstring.
