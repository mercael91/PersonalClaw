"""Binding expressions — how a node's output becomes another node's input.

`{{nodes.classify.output.findings | filter('verdict','CONFIRMED') | count}}`

Two resolution paths, deliberately distinct (WF2-R9):

* **Whole-value** — the string is exactly one `{{…}}` ref, so the SOURCE TYPE is
  preserved. `{{nodes.x.output}}` yields the dict, not `"{'a': 1}"`. A `foreach` over
  `{{nodes.x.output.items}}` needs a real list.
* **Interpolated** — the ref sits inside a larger string, so it stringifies. Scalars
  render bare; containers go through `json.dumps`, because embedding a Python `repr`
  into a prompt produces single-quoted pseudo-JSON that models reproduce badly.

The failure modes are also deliberately different. "The node produced null" flows
through as a value (`filter` drops nulls, a declarative `.filter(Boolean)`), while
"this reference does not resolve" — unknown node id, missing path — raises a typed
`BindingError` that gets journaled on the node. A silent empty string here is how a
prompt ends up quietly missing its input and the run produces confident nonsense.

Pipes are a CLOSED set of pure functions. No arbitrary expressions: a spec is data the
flywheel will later propose diffs to, and an eval-shaped hole in it is a remote-code
path with extra steps.

    The shape-agnostic sibling of `fenced_sources`. A template that interpolates stored or

    platform's fence. `fenced_sources` is that way for a RETRIEVED-KNOWLEDGE list

    numbering a list whose identity is an opaque id is the wrong rendering, not a missing key.

    A non-string value is JSON-dumped first (the same `json` pipe the sanitization set already
    accepts), then fenced whole. JSON escaping is NOT a fence — a dumped `\\n</untrusted_content>`
    arrives at the model as a real close marker, and `<|im_start|>` survives a dump untouched —
    so the dump is the serialization and `fence_untrusted` is the control. Fencing the dump ONCE
    (rather than per item) is deliberate: the fence's contract is a single balanced span, and a
    per-item fence over an opaque shape would have to invent a per-item rendering.

    Two roots carry a prior cycle's value — `previous` (the prior cycle of the enclosing
    `until_cancelled` body) and `last` (the prior iteration of the loop this node is in) — and
    on a first cycle neither exists. Raising there would make every diff-aware template fail
    on its own first pass unless it grew a branch node for the case, and it is the documented
    idiom (`{{last.output.summary | default("(this is the first pass)")}}`) that six bundled
    templates already ship. So the miss resolves to None and the pipe chain runs.

    **Keyed on a POSITIVE in-a-loop signal, never on absence alone**, because
    `absent-is-not-zero`: a rescue that fired wherever the root happened to be missing would
    render "(this is the first pass)" for a `last` read somewhere no iteration exists at all — a
    prompt quietly missing its input while the run reports success, which is the exact failure
    this module's docstring exists to prevent.

    * `previous` — `has_previous` is the context's own per-node declaration.
    * `last` — `iter_index is not None and not has_item` is the positive signal: this node is
      executing inside a loop BODY, so `last` names something real here. `has_item` excludes a
      `foreach`, which rebinds `iter_index` to an ITEM index — item 0 of a fan-out is not
      iteration 0 of a loop, and `last` means nothing there.

    Given that signal, `not has_last` is a MEASUREMENT rather than an unwired seam, which is what
    changed in #3524 and why the rule is no longer pinned to `iter_index == 0`. Both `previous`
    and `last` are now computed for every node the controller dispatches
    (`RunController._last_output` / `_previous_output`), so "the engine did not supply it" and
    "the engine looked and there was nothing to supply" are the same statement: either this is
    the first iteration, or the previous one produced no output at all. Both are honest
    `| default(...)` cases, and before #3524 the second rendered
    `unresolved reference at 'last'` on iterations 2..N of six bundled templates.

    A `last` read OUTSIDE any loop body (`iter_index is None`) and a typo'd `lastt` still raise —
    those are authoring errors, and nothing in the engine will ever supply them.

    This rule is about the ROOT being absent. The prior cycle being PRESENT but not carrying a
    field is a different fact with a different predicate — see `_prior_cycle_field_miss`.

    `_first_cycle_miss` rescues an absent prior-cycle ROOT. This rescues a path INTO a
    prior-cycle root that IS present — `{{last.output.summary | default("(first pass)")}}`
    resolving `last`, resolving `last.output`, and finding no `summary` on it. Measured on a
    real loop: a body stage declaring `schema {summary, meaningful_progress, evidence}` whose
    model returned prose instead of that JSON keeps an unstructured `{"result": "<text>"}`
    output, so every `last.output.<field>` read in the NEXT iteration is unresolvable and the
    iteration fails on a binding error naming a field nobody typed wrong. With a small local
    model that is the common case, not an edge case, and the template author had already
    written the fallback for exactly this — a `default` that `_pipe_default`'s own contract
    ("an unresolvable *reference* still raises") could never fire.

    **Why this cannot swallow an authoring error.** All five conditions must hold:

    1. the root is `last` or `previous` — a prior CYCLE, so `nodes.typo.output`,
       `inputs.typo`, `siblings.x.y` and a typo'd `lastt` are all outside this rule and raise
       exactly as before. That distinction is the same one `_first_cycle_miss` draws, and it is
       load-bearing for the same reason: a node id is statically knowable, so a typo in one is
       an authoring error that `validator._validate_binding_targets` already rejects before
       any run, while the key set of a model-produced output is knowable only at runtime;
    2. that root is actually PRESENT (`has_last` / `has_previous`) — the engine really did hand
       over a prior cycle. An unwired seam still raises, which is what keeps this from
       degenerating into the absence-keyed rescue `_first_cycle_miss` refuses;
    3. the second segment is literally `output` and a third segment exists — the miss is
       strictly INSIDE the value the prior cycle produced. `last.typo.summary` raises;
    4. the expression carries a `default(...)` pipe — the author has stated the fallback. With
       no default nobody has said what to use instead, and inventing one is the silent-empty-
       string failure this module exists to prevent, so it still raises. That is why the four
       bundled loop `condition`s reading `{{last.output.<field>}}` carry `| default(false)`
       rather than relying on this;
    5. not a `foreach` (`has_item`) — `last` means nothing over an item index.

    The residue, named rather than implied: a typo in the FIELD name (`last.output.sumary |
    default(…)`) is rescued too, because at this layer it is indistinguishable from a model
    that omitted the key. That is undecidable HERE, and the layer that can decide it is the
