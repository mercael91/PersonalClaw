"""App background-worker supervisor — the host ``permissions.backgroundTasks`` promised.

APE-1 shipped ``permissions.backgroundTasks`` as a *declaration* and said so out loud: the
note at ``apps/manifest.py:405`` reads "unlike ``backgroundTasks`` above, whose host still
does not exist". This module is that host, which is what turns the flag from disclosure
into a grant — every launch path funnels through one gate (:meth:`WorkerSupervisor._spawn`)
and an app that did not declare it gets no worker, ever.

**A worker is a portless backend.** Every question about process *lifetime* —
allowlisted child env, graceful-then-kill teardown, a watchdog that revives a crashed
child, boot-time PPID-1 orphan reaping — is already answered by
``apps/backend_runtime.py``, so this module reuses that machinery **by import** rather
than re-deriving it: ``_TERM_TIMEOUT`` (the graceful-then-kill budget),
``BackendSupervisor._launch_cmd`` (suffix→interpreter), and
``BackendSupervisor.reap_orphans`` (the PPID walk). A second PPID walk that disagreed
with the first is how a test run gets its own processes killed.

Two things a port bought a backend, and a worker does not have:

* **No health check, so "alive" means the process is running** — ``proc.poll() is None``,
  the same predicate ``RunningBackend.is_alive`` uses, and nothing stronger. A backend is
  *reachable*, so it can be asked. A worker has no inbound surface, so there is no one to
  ask. This module deliberately does not infer wedged-ness either: a worker blocked
  forever on a socket read is indistinguishable from one sleeping between iterations, and
  telling them apart needs a per-worker declared heartbeat interval — a manifest field and
  an SDK obligation, not a guess this layer can make. What that costs is stated plainly:
  a wedged-but-running worker is invisible here. What it buys is that "alive" never lies.
* **No ceiling of its own.** A backend serves requests someone asked for; a worker runs
  unattended forever, which is the denial-of-wallet surface the plan's Risk names. So this
  supervisor is policy-aware in a way the backend supervisor is not: it has a PAUSED state.

**PAUSED and stopped are different states, deliberately.** PAUSED is a *deferral* — the
day spend ceiling is breached or incident mode is on — so the record stays in the table
carrying the reason, and the next sweep resumes it by itself when the policy clears.
Stopped is an *answer* — the app was disabled, uninstalled, or lost the permission — so
the record is removed, exactly as ``BackendSupervisor.stop`` pops its row. Absence-vs-
PAUSED is the state difference, and it is what stops the two from collapsing: collapse
them one way and a budget breach permanently kills a worker the user never disabled;
collapse them the other and a disabled app's worker returns on the next sweep.

**The crash-loop bound is what makes revival safe.** A worker that dies during startup
would otherwise be relaunched every sweep forever, burning CPU and filling the log. After
``_MAX_RESTARTS`` revives that each failed to stay up for ``_HEALTHY_UPTIME_SECS``, the
supervisor gives up: state ``FAILED``, ``reason`` filled in, one ``logger.warning`` and one
notification. A silent give-up is indistinguishable from a working worker, so the give-up
is a fact you can read off the record, not an absence you have to infer.

Wiring (both out of this module's hands, on purpose): ``providers/loader.py`` starts the
backend watchdog at boot and should start :func:`start_worker_watchdog` the same way, and
``apps/app_manager.py`` — which already calls ``BackendSupervisor.reap_orphans`` on the
enable path — is where :meth:`WorkerSupervisor.start`/:meth:`stop` belong on
enable/disable. Neither is required for correctness: the sweep is self-healing (it starts
declared workers for enabled apps, stops them for disabled ones) and the first start of
any worker reaps that entry's orphans.
