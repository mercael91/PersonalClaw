"""App backend supervisor — launch/track an app's optional backend subprocess.

An app may declare a ``backend`` (``BackendConfig``: ``entryPoint`` / ``port`` /
``healthCheck`` / ``type``). When the app is enabled, the gateway launches that
entry point as an isolated **subprocess** bound to a localhost port, and the REST
layer reverse-proxies ``/apps/{name}/api/*`` to it (A4). This is the isolation
model chosen in the plan (§6.3) over an in-process ASGI mount.

This module owns the process table: start (pick a free port, spawn, record),
stop (terminate + reap), and lookup (the proxy asks "where is app X's backend?").
It does **not** proxy — that's the handler. It does **not** run setup hooks —
that's the lifecycle. A backend is just a localhost process here; its egress is
still subject to the egress layer like any other.

Process model: ``type`` selects the launcher — ``python`` runs
``python <entryPoint>``, ``node`` runs ``node <entryPoint>``; empty auto-detects
from the entry-point suffix (``.py``→python, ``.js``/``.mjs``→node). The chosen
port is passed via ``PORT`` env (the conventional contract) and recorded so the
proxy can reach it.

Environment: a backend does **not** inherit the gateway's environment. It receives
``sandbox.build_child_env(site="app-backend")`` — the ``CHILD_ENV_BASE_NAMES``
allowlist plus whatever the operator declared in ``sandbox.env_passthrough`` — layered
with the four variables this module computes (``PORT``, ``PERSONALCLAW_APP_NAME``,
``PERSONALCLAW_APP_SECRET``, and ``PERSONALCLAW_APP_DATA_DIR`` when the app holds the
``storage`` capability), plus (APE-10) a read-only ``PERSONALCLAW_APP_SHARED_DIR_<SHARER>``
for every app it holds a ``storageRead`` grant on. See ``docs/architecture/app-platform.md``.
