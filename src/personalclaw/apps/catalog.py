"""App catalog — what's AVAILABLE to install, for the Store half of the App page.

The App page has two halves:
  * **Library** — what's installed (``apps.manager.list_apps``).
  * **Store** — what's available to install, which this module enumerates from two
    sources:
      1. **Native** — manifests PersonalClaw ships under ``apps/native/`` (native)
         that aren't currently installed (e.g. a default provider the user
         force-uninstalled, or a bundled app they haven't added yet).
      2. **Git sources** — a user-managed list of git URLs (seeded with any
         PersonalClaw-bundled defaults). Each entry is an installable app source;
         the catalog reports it as available without cloning (the clone happens at
         install time, behind the scanner gate).

A catalog entry is metadata only — installing one routes through the normal
``app_manager.install`` (path for bundled, git URL for sources), so the scanner
gate + lifecycle are unchanged.

# Git source URLs PersonalClaw ships as Store defaults. The published first-party

# per-app install-consent contract is preserved (nothing runs until the user opts
# in). User-added URLs accumulate alongside these. This is a Store-listing default
# only — it never auto-installs.
#
# 🔴 It is still folded into every read of :func:`list_git_sources`, so it cannot be
# removed ROW-WISE — but it is no longer un-turn-off-able. ``apps.bundled_source_enabled``
# drops it from every read, and :func:`network_source_hosts` names the hosts a Store read
# reaches so the surface can DISCLOSE the egress. Before this, "cannot be turned off" and
# "happens before the user configured anything" held together (#2528 finding 1), which is
# a stronger claim than the rest of this codebase makes — an app can declare
# ``"network": false``. A Store with no sources is a poor first run, so the default stays

# on it is a normal user entry: the existing DELETE removes it, and the marker — which survives
# the removal — is what stops the next start from seeding it again.

# That is a COLLISION TO RESOLVE BY RULE, not a tie to break by arrival order — and
# before this, five scan functions each kept a private ``seen`` set and the three
# frontend merges each concatenated the wire lists in a DIFFERENT order, so "which copy
# won" depended on who you asked. The card a user reads (description, permissions, tags)
# could therefore describe different bytes than the ones about to be installed, with
# nothing on screen naming which copy won.
#
# ``SOURCE_PRECEDENCE`` is the whole rule: earlier wins. It is ordered by how much the
# user can be said to have vouched for the bytes:
#   * ``native``      — ships inside the wheel; mandatory, and resurfaced only to self-heal.
#   * ``bundled``     — also shipped with the product.
#   * ``first-party`` — the workspace ``apps/`` dir on this machine (dev/offline).
#   * ``local``       — a directory the USER added. They put these bytes on disk.
#   * ``git``         — a remote. Least vouched-for, so it never shadows anything above it.
# A remote git source can no longer shadow a local one; a genuinely-bundled app is still

# surface that WITHOUT a polling loop: the latest-available version is computed on
# the existing ``/api/apps`` read path from CHEAP, on-disk local-source manifest
# reads (the same dir-scan ``_scan_local_sources`` does) — no network clone on the
# hot path. The Store keeps its own (cached, network-capable) discovery for BROWSING;
# this is the always-cheap "is anything I already have out of date?" check.
#
# One notification per ``(name, latest_version)`` is delivered through the registered
# ``apps/update`` attention kind, deduped by a persisted ``entity_settings/app_updates.json``
# high-water mark so re-computing on every read never re-nags — only a version NEWER than the
# one already announced fires again.
