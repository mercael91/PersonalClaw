"""App Platform lifecycle — install / enable / disable / uninstall (A1).

The runtime is PClaw-native, built on top of
the existing manifest (:mod:`apps.manifest`) + storage primitives
(:mod:`apps.manager`). Turns "read what's present" into a real, safety-gated
lifecycle:

* **install(source)** — copy → **stage in quarantine** → validate manifest →
  **scan staged content** (the shared :class:`SkillScanner` gate; ``dangerous``
  is terminal, non-overridable) → require consent for risky verdicts → run
  ``setup.onInstall`` (bounded subprocess) → register providers → write
  ``installed.json``.
* **enable / disable(name)** — run ``setup.onEnable``/``onDisable`` (bounded),
  flip the provider registration.

Removal is a THREE-rung ladder, and each rung is a different promise about the
user's ``data/`` — the notes they wrote, a campaign's ledger, an incident log:

* **uninstall(name)** — DEACTIVATE. Nothing leaves disk; the app is turned off.
* **uninstall_keep_data(name)** — the app's files go, ``data/`` is KEPT (parked at
  ``apps/.{name}.data``) and a later ``install`` of the same name puts it back. It
  REFUSES while an earlier unconsumed copy of that ``data/`` is still on disk, rather
  than deleting or overwriting one — :func:`_unconsumed_data_copies` owns that question.
* **force_uninstall(name)** — everything goes, ``data/`` included.

The middle rung exists because the first two alone force a choice between leaving a
dead app installed forever and destroying the user's data (issue #2541).

Every lifecycle action is SEL-audited. Executing a third-party ``setup`` hook is
RCE-by-design, so a hook only runs after the scanner passes (or the caller gives
explicit consent for a ``warning``) — never on a ``dangerous`` verdict, and never
auto-forced for an unattended/agent-initiated install.

Atomic update + rollback is A2; the dependency ledger is A3; this is the core.

    Installing an app runs ``pip install`` into ``<home>/app-python``, and the gateway loads
    what lands there into its OWN process (after its own packages, so nothing it already uses
    is replaced). That is materially more consequential than most of what the consent dialog
    already enumerates, and the dialog said nothing about it: it listed gateway permissions,
    app messaging, desktop and network reach and dashboard code, and never that a
    third-party package lands in the interpreter holding the owner's credentials,
    filesystem and network. ``docs/security/limitations.md`` §3 documents the
    behaviour, which does not discharge the duty of the surface where consent is
    actually given — a user clicking through a modal does not read the threat model.
    So this exists to put the real specifiers on that screen.

    ``coreOwned`` is the distinction that makes the disclosure honest rather than

    :func:`_reject_core_dependency_conflicts` gates on, never a hand-kept list:

      * ``False`` — core does not declare this name, so pip may genuinely install new code

        ``slack-sdk``) land here: they are core *extras*, which
        :func:`_core_requirement_pins` excludes on purpose.
      * ``True`` — core declares it (``Pillow``, ``numpy``). Nothing new enters: the
        guard admits the pin only while the version already installed satisfies it and
        refuses the install otherwise, so this reads as "a version you already have is
        acceptable", not as "new code enters your interpreter".

    ``True`` is claimed only when PROVEN. Best-effort by design — this runs per app on
    every catalog scan, so a shape surprise must not break the Store — and an
    unreadable core pin set degrades every spec to ``False``, i.e. to the LOUDER of the
    two disclosures. That is the same fail-closed direction the guard takes, one
    surface along: over-disclosing a package is safe, under-disclosing one is the
    defect being fixed. The specs themselves are always returned verbatim, because
    losing them is the only outcome worse than mis-grouping them.

    Before this, that question was answered implicitly in three places by call ORDER
    rather than by looking — and each of the three answers was wrong in a state the

    * :func:`uninstall_keep_data` treated an existing STAGE as leftover garbage and
      ``rmtree``'d it. Only that function ever writes that path, and it leaves one behind
      in exactly one case: a park that failed, where the stage is the user's LAST copy
      (#2574). So the one state the sweep could ever find was the one it must not touch.
    * the same function ``rmtree``'d an existing PARK before moving the new copy over it.
      A park coexists with an installed app only when an earlier restore FAILED, so that
      copy is data the user has never seen — and the delete was ``ignore_errors=True``,
      so when it silently failed instead, ``shutil.move`` found a directory at the
      destination and moved the stage INSIDE it, reporting success.
    * :func:`force_uninstall` — which the middle rung calls to do its removal — discards
      any park for the name. Reached from ``uninstall_keep_data``, that wipes the earlier
      unconsumed copy before the new one is even made, and returns ``True``.

    Both paths are checked together because both are the same kind of thing (a copy of
    the user's ``data/`` that no live app tree holds) and the caller's decision is the
    same for both: do not proceed, name them, let the user resolve it. Consulting one and
    not the other is how the family got three members.

    is locked against it.

    Deliberately ADD-OR-OVERWRITE, never delete. A file the wheel stopped shipping is left
    behind because nothing distinguishes it from something a user or another tool put there,

    🔴 THREE STATES USED TO DISAGREE (issues 334, 368). The ScheduleService retirement deleted

    removed it from an existing install. Measured on a home upgraded across six `main` SHAs: the
    app stayed installed and enabled, `_is_native()` locked it against disable AND uninstall
    (`origin="builtin"`), `GET /api/apps` rendered it beside 28 working built-ins with an
    "Installed" badge and no error, `DELETE` answered `404 not installed` while the list said it
    was, and every gateway boot logged an `AttributeError` from `load_factory`. The only escape
    was hand-editing the home.

    The precedent was already here as a hardcoded one-shot for `ollama-models`, which this
    replaces: that app is one instance of the general rule, so a second retirement would have
    needed a second one-shot. Nothing is left beside this — the block is deleted, not bypassed.

    Two outcomes, decided by whether the app can still run:

    * **Dead** — its provider named a core factory that no longer exists, so the app cannot work
      and the platform installed it without asking. Unlock it, disable it, and remove the
      directory — but ONLY when it holds no user data. An app whose `data/` has contents is
      unlocked and disabled and left in place: a retirement must not delete something the user
      may want, and an unlocked app is removable in one click.
    * **De-cored** — the packaged source is gone but the implementation is not a dead core
      factory (it moved into the app's own files, `ollama-models`' history). Unlock only; it
      still works, so it keeps running as an ordinary user-manageable app.

    The app is gone from every surface; the data the user made with it is parked at
    ``apps/.{name}.data``, and a later :func:`install` of the same name puts it back.
    Closes the gap in issue #2541: before this, the ladder was "don't remove it"
    (:func:`uninstall`) and "remove everything" (:func:`force_uninstall`), so a user
    who wanted the app gone but their notes kept had no path at all.

    Two pieces of machinery are REUSED rather than reimplemented, because a second
    copy of either is a second thing that can drift:

    * the preserving copy is the one :func:`update` already performs — ``live/data``
      copied out before the tree it lives in is replaced — staged through the same
      quarantine dir install/update stage through;
    * the removal is :func:`force_uninstall` itself, unchanged: its hooks, its
      deregistration, its dependency-ledger accounting, its ``rmtree``.

    FAIL-CLOSED on preservation. If ``data/`` cannot be copied out, NOTHING is
    removed. An operation whose entire promise is "your data survives this" must not
    proceed to the delete having failed to keep that promise.

    And past that point — the removal has happened and the PARK then fails — the staged
    copy is LEFT in quarantine and the audit line names it, because by then it is the
    only copy there is. ``False`` with ``data=park_failed staged_copy=…`` means "the app
    is gone, your data is at that path"; it never means the data is gone (#2574).

    FAIL-CLOSED on an EARLIER copy, too. Both of this rung's own paths can already hold a
    copy of the user's data from a previous run that nothing consumed — a park that failed
    leaves the stage, a restore that failed leaves the park — and every way of proceeding
    over one destroys it. So :func:`_unconsumed_data_copies` is consulted FIRST, before
    anything is copied or removed, and a non-empty answer refuses with
    ``data=unconsumed_copy <paths>`` (#2585). This rung never resolves that itself: the
    "cleanup" for each is a delete in a failure path, which is how #2574 happened.

    EVERY ``False`` NAMES ITSELF. This rung returns a bare ``bool``, so the log line is the
    only place a caller — a user reading ``gateway.log``, or CI reading a red — can learn
    WHY an app it asked to remove is still installed. Two branches used to answer with
    nothing at all (the preservation copy failing, and a name that cannot hold a parked
    copy), which is how a real failure of this rung reached main as ``assert False is True``
    with no cause anywhere in the output. So each refusal/error path of an INSTALLED app
    emits a ``logger.error`` naming the app and the reason, and
    ``tests/test_app_uninstall_preserves_data.py`` holds that as an invariant over the
    branches rather than per-branch — paired with the success path, which must stay silent.

    Because that refusal comes first, the park below needs no ``rmtree`` of its own
    destination — the destination is provably absent — so it is a single
    :meth:`~pathlib.Path.rename`. Both paths live under ``apps/``, always the same
    filesystem, so that rename is ATOMIC: there is no cross-device ``copytree`` fallback
    to fail halfway and no ``shutil.move`` destination-is-a-directory case to nest the
    stage inside an older park. A parked copy is now complete by CONSTRUCTION, which is
    the guarantee :func:`_restore_preserved_data` relies on when it treats one as
    authoritative — previously that guarantee lived only in the order these two functions
    happened to be called in.
