"""Where installed apps' Python packages live: ``<home>/app-python``, a pip ``--prefix``.

An app declares ``dependencies.pythonDependencies``; the installer pip-installs them into this
directory — never into the environment the gateway runs from — and every process that runs app
code loads them AFTER the interpreter's own ``site-packages``.

Why here, and why this shape:

* **It is the one writable, persistent place on every install kind.** The published image runs
  as uid 10001 over a root-owned ``/opt/venv``, so installing into the running environment failed
  with ``[Errno 13] Permission denied`` for every app whose packages the image did not already
  carry (Amazon Bedrock, both diarization apps, RapidOCR, Qdrant) — and a writable image layer
  would still have lost them on the next ``docker rm`` + ``docker run``. The home is ``/data``
  there and ``~/.personalclaw`` on a pip/uv install: one code path, no container special case.
* **An app can add packages; it can neither change nor shadow the gateway's.** The directory is
  APPENDED to ``sys.path`` (:func:`activate`), so a module the gateway already provides always
  wins the import. And pip resolves against the running environment with every distribution the
  gateway can import PINNED by a constraints file, so a dependency that needs another version of
  one of them fails resolution instead of being installed. Measured without the pins: ``pip
  install --prefix`` resolved a conflicting ``urllib3`` by UNINSTALLING the base environment's
  copy — on a user-owned venv that deletes a package core is running on.
* **One directory for every app, not one per app.** In-process app code shares one interpreter,
  and an interpreter imports one version of a module: a second app's copy of a package is simply
  shadowed by the first's, so per-app directories would promise an isolation Python cannot give.
  Instead pip resolves EVERY installed app's requirements in one run, so what it installs is a
  version all of them accept — or the install is refused, naming the conflict.
* **Garbage-collected from metadata, not reference-counted.** :func:`collect` deletes every
  distribution here that no app's requirement closure reaches — after an uninstall, an update,
  a failed install and at boot. It is derived from the manifests and dist-info on disk each
  time, so there is no ledger to drift out of step with them.
* **A version change replaces the old copy.** An update whose new manifest pins another
  version (up or down) gets exactly that version. pip resolves it, but it cannot remove the
  copy it replaces here (:func:`_drop_displaced` says why), so the installer does, right after
  pip succeeds. The copy pip wrote last is the one every reader of this directory treats as
  installed.
* **Reproducible, so rebuilt rather than backed up.** The directory is a function of the
  installed apps' manifests and the running interpreter (its layout is keyed by the Python
  version), which is why :func:`broken_apps` + :func:`install_everything` can rebuild whatever a
  new image's Python, a changed core dependency or a restored snapshot leaves missing, and why
  the durability inventory ignores it.
