"""Register an app's declared MCP servers into the live MCP config.

An app may ship its OWN MCP server(s) in ``manifest.mcpServers`` (distinct from
``dependencies`` MCP servers it merely needs). Those were parsed but never wired
into the running system. This bridge writes them into PClaw's MCP store
(``~/.personalclaw/mcp.json`` ``mcpServers`` — the same file
:mod:`providers.mcp_instances` and :mod:`mcp_client` read) on enable/install, and
removes them on disable/uninstall.

Entries are namespaced ``{app}:{server}`` so two apps (or an app and the user)
can't collide on a server key, and so deregistration removes exactly this app's
servers and nothing else.
