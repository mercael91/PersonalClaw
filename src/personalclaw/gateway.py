"""Gateway process orchestrator for PersonalClaw.

Manages the lifecycle of all runtime services: session manager, cron
scheduler, context builder, heartbeat, autonudge, inbox, MCP discovery,
subagents, task runner, dashboard / API server, update checks, and signal
handling. This is the core process boot — it runs with or without any external
channel configured.

Channel connectivity is optional and pluggable via the channel-transport seam: the
gateway binds itself as the services handle at boot, and from then on
``channel_transports.reconcile_inbound`` runs each configured channel's receiver
(``start_inbound`` — Slack Socket-Mode lives entirely in the ``slack-channel`` app
bundle) and stops it again, whenever a channel is enabled, changed or removed. The
transport registers its outbound :class:`~personalclaw.channel_delivery.ChannelDelivery`
on the orchestrator. Core imports NO vendor channel code. With no channel configured
the gateway runs dashboard-only.

    `state_history` declares three writing surfaces and the time-travel panel's "what changed
    while I slept" filter reads them — but `SURFACE_BACKGROUND` had ZERO producers. Measured: the
    only `writing_surface` call in the whole tree was `state_history.py`'s own hourly maintenance
    job, which sets `SURFACE_SCHEDULED`. So a commit caused by a clock / file / webhook / chained
    fire was recorded on the DEFAULT `interactive` surface, and the filter could not tell an
    automation's edit from something the user did at the keyboard — the one distinction the whole
    surface field exists to make.

    A decorator rather than a `with` inside the method, for SCOPE. The surface is read by the
    post-write hook in the WRITER's context (`history_debounce.notify` calls
    `sh.current_surface()`), so it has to be live for every write the dispatch causes: the
    injection-screen refusal row, the denylist and rung refusal rows, the provider's own writes,
    the outcome record, and the chained fires in the `finally`. A context wrapped around only
    `provider.execute` would leave the rest unlabelled — the same bug in a smaller box.

    Unconditionally `background` because unattendedness is NOT a second decision taken here: this
    seam resolves its guardrail identity as `unattended_dispatch_key("trigger:<id>")`, which
    `is_unattended_session` classifies as unattended BY CONSTRUCTION — a store-trigger fire has no
    chat session by definition, which is exactly why the denylist and the rung ladder below already
    judge it under the HEADLESS posture. Branching on that key here would add a second, parallel
    notion of "unattended" whose else-arm is unreachable. The ATTENDED counterpart is a different
    function — `dashboard.handlers.triggers._dispatch_store_action`, the hand-driven "run now" —
    which keeps the default `interactive` surface and is untouched by this.

    The surface travels on a ContextVar, so it survives the `await`s inside the dispatch. It does
    not cross a `run_in_executor` boundary; that is a property of the seam `state_history` chose,
    shared with the `SURFACE_SCHEDULED` producer, and not something this wrap changes.

        This process is the only one that knows the answer, so it is the only one allowed

        environment (inherited by every child we spawn) and in a per-home runtime record
        (readable by a child whose environment was rebuilt from an allowlist).

        Before the owner existed, each child worked the base out for itself from
        ``dashboard.url`` or from the import-time ``DASHBOARD_PORT``, and BOTH fall back to
        the fixed 10000. Neither ``--port`` nor ``--port auto`` writes that config, so a
        gateway on another port addressed its children at 10000 — which on a multi-instance
        host is a DIFFERENT instance, not a dead socket (#2539). Two earlier symptoms of the
        same root: ``subagent_run`` answering ``<urlopen error [Errno 61] Connection
        refused>`` on a kiro ACP session while the in-process tools beside it worked
        (`AAP-3`, `K58`), and a ``run-script`` action's ``ctx.notify()`` persisting into a
        second instance's notification store.

        No ``if self._dashboard_port:`` guard: an unset/zero port here means we bound but
        cannot say to what, and ``publish()`` raises. Failing at startup is the honest
        answer — the guard's silence just deferred the same failure to the first tool call,
        by which time the request had already gone somewhere.
