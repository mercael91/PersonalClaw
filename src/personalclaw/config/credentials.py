"""The credential store — two backends behind one API (SECURITY-HARDENING C1 + SH-2).

🔴 **WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE.** It began as a section of ``config/loader.py``. That file
sits at the top of ``scripts/generate_structural_baseline.py``'s ``SIZE_CEILING_LINES``
watch band, with ~100 lines of headroom, and ``tests/test_structural_baseline.py`` names
this exact scenario in its docstring: "adding one boolean toggle would red CI". SH-2 adds a
boolean toggle (``security.credential_keychain``), a keychain delete and a ``.env`` removal
path, so the cohesive section those belong to moved out to pay for them. Same reasoning and
same shape as ``agents/native/decision_tool_defs.py``, extracted from ``builtin_tools.py``
for the same rail. **There is no re-export shim in ``loader``** — importers were updated.

Two backends sit behind :func:`save_credential` / :func:`get_credential` /
:func:`credential_names` / :func:`delete_credential` / ``AppConfig.load_credentials``. Callers
never name one:

  ``keychain``  the OS secret service via the OPTIONAL ``keyring`` extra (macOS Keychain,
                Linux Secret Service, Windows Credential Locker). Opt-in with
                ``security.credential_keychain`` in ``config.json`` or
                ``PERSONALCLAW_CREDENTIAL_BACKEND=keychain``.
  ``dotenv``    ``~/.personalclaw/.env`` at mode 0600 — the default, and the FAIL-CLOSED
                destination whenever the keychain is unavailable or errors. There is no
                third location: a headless box that asked for a keychain and has none keeps
                its secrets in that same 0600 file and is TOLD SO by ``doctor`` — never a
                new plaintext file somewhere else, never looser permissions.

The write/read asymmetry is deliberate:
  * WRITES go to the ACTIVE backend only (:func:`credential_backend`), falling back to
    ``.env`` 0600 if the keychain write fails.
  * READS are the UNION of both stores, keychain preferred, regardless of which backend is
    active. That is what makes reads backend-transparent: flipping the gate back off must
    not make an already-stored secret vanish, and SH-2's ``credentials_to_keychain`` move
    needs both halves readable while it carries keys across.

The consented move itself lives in :mod:`personalclaw.config.credential_migration`, which
is a *one-time operation* on this store rather than part of it.

⚠️  **Nothing from ``loader`` is bound by name here** — the module is imported and every use
goes through ``_loader.env_path()`` / ``_loader.AppConfig``. That is deliberate, and the first
draft got it wrong: binding ``env_path`` made ``patch("personalclaw.config.loader.env_path")``
miss this module entirely (three tests in ``test_shepherd_fixes.py`` caught it, having patched
exactly that spelling for years). Attribute access defers the lookup, so BOTH the
``loader.config_dir`` and the ``loader.env_path`` patch spellings redirect us. The module import
is the safe direction of the cycle: ``loader`` imports THIS module only inside
``AppConfig.load_credentials``, so by the time any credential is read ``loader`` is complete.
