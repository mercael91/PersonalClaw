"""App Platform REST API (A4).

The lifecycle layer (A1–A3) exposed over HTTP, plus the backend reverse-proxy:

    GET    /api/apps                      — installed apps + state
    GET    /api/apps/{name}               — manifest + status + config + backend
    POST   /api/apps/preview              — what installing/updating a source grants + runs
    POST   /api/apps                      — install from source (path | git URL), with consent
    POST   /api/apps/{name}/enable        — enable (run onEnable, register)
    POST   /api/apps/{name}/disable       — disable
    POST   /api/apps/{name}/update        — atomic update from source
    DELETE /api/apps/{name}               — deactivate | ?remove=1 remove-keep-data
                                            | ?force=1 remove-everything (dep ledger)
    GET    /api/apps/{name}/uninstall-preview — classify shared deps (A3) + data/ facts
    GET    /api/apps/{name}/config        — read config + the configSchema
    PUT    /api/apps/{name}/config        — validate + persist config
    *      /apps/{name}/api/{tail:.*}      — reverse-proxy to the app's backend

Lifecycle routes are SEL-audited inside the manager. Install/update run the
shared scanner gate: a ``dangerous`` verdict or an invalid signature is refused
(non-overridable). Everything else commits only with CONSENT: ``POST
/api/apps/preview`` stages the source and returns what it grants and runs, the
scan of those exact bytes, and a ``consent`` digest; an install (or an update that
changes what the app gets, or scans with warnings) commits only when the request
echoes that digest back as ``consent``, and only if the bytes still match it. A
request without it — ``confirm: true`` included — is answered 409 with the same
review, and nothing is installed.
