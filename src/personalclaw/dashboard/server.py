    Only acts on requests carrying an app identity (``request["app"]`` set

    403 before the handler runs — the half an app's own BACKEND cannot talk its
    way past, since its token is the only credential it holds. Owner/dashboard
    requests (no app identity) pass.

    🪤 That is not a boundary on an app's FRONTEND (#492). An app's UI bundle is
    imported into the dashboard page itself, so a bare ``fetch`` from it carries
    the owner's cookie and no app identity, arrives indistinguishable from the
    dashboard's own request, and passes here by the rule above. Nothing on this
    side can tell the two apart — separating them needs a distinct ORIGIN for app
    bundles, which is why this is a disclosed limitation
    (``docs/security/limitations.md`` §4, surfaced at install consent) rather than
    a check that could be added here.

    The decision itself is ``permissions.app_request_denial``, not inline here, and this
    is a module-level function rather than a closure inside :func:`start_dashboard` so a
    test drives THIS middleware instead of a mirror of it (a mirror is free to drift from
    the boundary it claims to test). This half owns logging the refusal and shaping the
    response; the module owns what is refused.

    It hands the decision the matched route's canonical template as well as the path,
    because the per-route declarations (``permissions.ROUTE_AUTHZ``) are keyed on it:
    ``POST /api/triggers`` and ``POST /api/triggers/{id}/run`` share a prefix and not a
    verdict. A row that carries ``owns`` is then held to the conversations the calling app
    started (:func:`_conversation_denial`). An allowed app request runs inside

    A body target reads the JSON body, which aiohttp keeps, so the handler reads the same bytes
