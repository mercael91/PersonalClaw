"""Async bundled-model downloads with live progress (the model-fetch job runner).

Bundled model providers (embedding / STT / TTS) fetch their weights from
HuggingFace, which can take minutes. A synchronous download route would hold the
request open for the whole fetch and give the UI no progress. This module turns
each download into a background **job** that streams progress over the SSE
substrate (``dashboard/sse.py``):

- :class:`ModelDownloadJob` — one in-flight or finished download in the ONE
  canonical wire shape (LMMV §4.1): ``kind`` / ``state`` / ``progress`` /
  ``downloaded_bytes`` vs ``total_bytes`` / ``speed_bps`` / ``eta_s`` / ``reason``.
- :class:`ModelDownloadRegistry` — owns the jobs, dedupes by ``(kind, model)``,
  runs the blocking fetch off the event loop, and polls bytes-on-disk to publish
  ``progress`` frames on a per-job hub keyed ``download:<id>``.

Progress is **best-effort by on-disk growth**, not HuggingFace's internal tqdm:
a job snapshots the size of the kind's cache root at start and reports the delta
as it grows. No coupling to ``hf_hub`` internals; the trade-off is that two
concurrent downloads of the *same kind* would share a baseline (rare — jobs
dedupe per model, and the UI downloads one at a time). The expected total
(``size_mb`` from each provider's catalog) lets the client render a determinate
``progress`` bar; without it ``progress`` is ``0.0`` (indeterminate). ``speed_bps``
and ``eta_s`` are derived coarsely from the per-tick on-disk delta — honest zeros
when the delta or total is unknown, never fabricated.

Cancellation detaches the job (stops the stream, drops it from the registry).
A HuggingFace fetch already in a worker thread cannot be interrupted cleanly, so
the underlying download may still finish in the background — the job just stops
being tracked.
