"""Provider-contributed media-model catalogs (STT / TTS / image-gen).

The OpenAI-compatible audio + images *protocol* clients live in core
(``stt/openai_provider.py``, ``tts/openai_provider.py``, ``image_gen/openai_provider.py``)
and speak to ANY openai-compatible endpoint — that is a core capability. But WHICH
concrete models an endpoint serves, and the sensible unpinned default, is
VENDOR-specific knowledge (OpenAI serves ``whisper-1`` / ``gpt-image-1`` / ``dall-e-*``;
Alibaba serves ``qwen-image-*``; a generic gateway serves whatever the user pins).

Rather than hard-code OpenAI's catalog in the core adapters, that vendor data is
CONTRIBUTED here, keyed by provider TYPE, by the provider's own app bundle
(``apps/openai-models`` registers OpenAI's audio/image catalog on load). Core adapters
look their catalog up by the config provider's ``type``; a type with no contributed
catalog (a bring-your-own gateway) advertises no curated models and requires a pinned
model — exactly the previous ``_is_openai_endpoint()`` behavior, now provider-declared
instead of host-sniffed.

Data-only (no logic): each entry is an :class:`MediaCatalog` of model rows + an
optional default model id, per capability (``stt`` / ``tts`` / ``image_gen``).
