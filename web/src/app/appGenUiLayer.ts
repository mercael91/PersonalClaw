/** The L1 genui component layer: app-contributed components (AMBIENT-SURFACES §5.1/§6).
 *
 *  Loaded at the SHELL, once, for every ENABLED app that declares both a components
 *  module (`ui.components`) and the `generative-component` UI capability. Deliberately
 *  not at the app's page mount: a chat-born widget can name an app component without the
 *  user ever having opened that app, and a registry that only fills in after a page visit
 *  would drop the same line with `unknown-component` depending on where you had been.
 *
 *  Every load is error-boundaried in the value sense — one app's broken module is caught,
 *  logged and skipped; the remaining apps still register. Safe mode (`maxLayer = 0`)
 *  refuses the whole pass without fetching anything.
 *
 *  The contract an app's module exports:
 *
 *      export function register(sdk, ctx) {
 *        sdk.registerComponent(ctx, { name: 'AcmeGauge', group: 'Data', … })
 *      }
 *
 *  `sdk` is the host's `@personalclaw/app-sdk/genui` module (so the app calls the SAME
 *  gated entry point a bundled page would) and `ctx` is the app identity the gate reads. */
