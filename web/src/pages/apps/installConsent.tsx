/** The APP INSTALL-CONSENT surface — the one path every install and update takes, and
 *  everything a user is shown before anything is installed.
 *
 *  🔑 ONE PATH, NOT A COMPONENT PER SURFACE. The Store card, the Store detail panel, Manage
 *  Sources, Install from URL, Update, and the first-run essential-apps step all open THIS
 *  dialog through {@link useAppInstall}. It used to be a modal each caller opened only when
 *  the scanner objected, so a clean-scanning app installed on one click with no consent
 *  screen at all — measured on the real image, 50 of 65 Store installs, including Growth
 *  Tracker (API reach into projects, tasks and knowledge, an agent grant, a daily cron) and
 *  Research Lab (an hourly background agent), whose jobs then sat in `triggers.json`,
 *  enabled, unseen.
 *
 *  🔑 WHAT IT DISCLOSES IS THE SERVER'S READING OF THE BYTES ABOUT TO BE INSTALLED. The
 *  dialog opens by asking `POST /api/apps/preview`, which stages the source, scans it and
 *  returns what it grants and runs (`apps/disclosure.describe`) plus a `consent` digest of
 *  those exact bytes; Install sends the digest back, and the server installs only if the
 *  bytes still match. So a registry listing or a pasted URL — whose manifest the catalog
 *  never read — is disclosed as fully as a local card, and a source that changes between
 *  the review and the click is reviewed again instead of installed on the first yes.
 *
 *  It lives in its own module because the onboarding step renders it too, and a static
 *  import of the whole Store page from the first-run flow would pull the Store into the
 *  first-load bundle. */
