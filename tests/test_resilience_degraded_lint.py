"""Degraded-contract coverage lint (PLATFORM-RESILIENCE §5).

The floor doctrine: "a lint test asserts every ``use_case=`` call site maps to a
registered contract — the mechanism that keeps FUTURE surfaces honest." Concretely:
every source file that calls ``one_shot_completion(`` (a non-interactive model call)
must map to a registered ``DegradedContract`` surface, so a new model-dependent
surface can't ship without declaring its no-model floor.

Mapping is by call-site FILE, not by the ``use_case=`` string: the informal labels
``"background"``/``"ingestion"`` both collapse to the ``reasoning`` axis inside
``one_shot_completion`` (verified), so the use-case string is not a stable surface
key — the owning file is.
