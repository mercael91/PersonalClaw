"""`GET /api/model-providers` reported every provider's stored key as missing.

(The field was `credential_status`; it is `key_in_store` now — whether the instance's key
lives in the credential store. Whether an instance CONNECTS is its measured `connection`,
see `providers/connection.py`, and no longer inferred from a credential's presence.)

Co-located with issue 2217's census work: the census resolves `credentials.json` from
`dashboard/handlers/providers.py`, and reading that one write path is what surfaced this.

`CredentialStore.__init__` takes a **home directory**; it then read `<home>/credentials.json`
and `<home>/.env`, and now reads `<home>/.env` and the OS keychain, the store Settings → Secrets
writes. Measured on the tree: eleven call sites constructed one, and ten passed a home. This one
passed `config_dir() / "credentials.json"`, so the store looked beneath a file, found nothing,
and `resolve()` raised `KeyError` for every name — swallowed by the handler's
`except Exception` into `"missing"`.

So a correctly configured provider rendered as having no credential, on the surface whose
whole job is to report whether the credential is there.
