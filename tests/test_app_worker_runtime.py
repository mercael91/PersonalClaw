"""The supervision half of APE-3: what `apps/worker_runtime.py` promises about processes.

`permissions.backgroundTasks` shipped in APE-1 with the manifest itself admitting the gap —
`apps/manifest.py:405`: "unlike ``backgroundTasks`` above, whose host still does not exist".
These tests are the host's contract, and they are deliberately split by what the claim is
ABOUT:

* **Claims about processes are made with real processes.** Crash survival kills a real
  child and asserts a real replacement. Graceful-vs-kill teardown is decided by the child's
  own `returncode` (0 from its SIGTERM handler, `-SIGKILL` when it ignored the signal), not
  by which branch we believe was taken. Reaping spawns a genuine orphan through
  `/bin/sh … &` and a genuine still-parented sibling running the SAME entry path, and
  asserts BOTH directions — a reaper that kills live processes is worse than one that
  misses orphans.
* **Claims about policy are made with fakes.** The crash-loop bound, the budget breach and
  the notification are decisions, so they are driven by patching the real seams
  (`guardrails.budgets.budget_from_config`/`get_meter`, `guardrails.incident.incident_active`,
  `action_providers.services.get_action_services`) rather than by spending money or
  declaring an incident.

`apps/background.py` (the sibling half — the app-facing contract behind
`sdk/background.py`) is NOT stubbed: the real module is imported, so
`BACKGROUND_TASKS_PERMISSION`, `WORKER_ENTRY_POINT`, `WORKER_DEFAULT_NAME` and
`WORKER_ID_ENV` are the shipped values rather than a fixture's guess at them. The one thing
still injected is WHICH workers a manifest declares (`_stub_background` below), because the
real `declared_workers` derives exactly one from the permission and these tests need several.
That real derivation is exercised — with a vacuity floor — by
`test_app_background_contract.py::test_the_entry_point_an_app_is_told_to_use_is_the_one_the_
supervisor_resolves`, so patching it here strands nothing.

No test here sleeps for a fixed duration in place of a condition: every wait polls to a
deadline, because a fixed sleep measures a skeleton and goes flaky under xdist. Every
process a test creates is registered with the `spawned` fixture, which kills leftovers at
teardown and then ASSERTS none survived.
