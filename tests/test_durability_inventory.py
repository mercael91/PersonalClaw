"""DURABILITY §1 — the state inventory and the gap it closes.

The inventory exists because two hand-maintained allowlists (`snapshot.CORE_FILES`
and `portability.EXPORT_EXCLUDE`) had drifted from reality: nine real store
directories were backed up by NEITHER. These tests lock the three properties that
keep that from recurring:

1. the manifest is internally well-formed (no typos in kind/domain/merge, no
   duplicate ids or paths);
2. `audit_home` FAILS on an unclaimed path or an undeclared database — this is
   the guard that catches a newly added store;
3. every database is declared, so it gets the sqlite backup API rather than a
   filesystem copy of a live WAL store.
