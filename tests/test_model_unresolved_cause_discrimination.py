"""#3408 — ``ERR_MODEL_UNRESOLVED`` names the cause that actually fired.

``_resolve_from_config_registry`` answers a bare ``None`` for every reason an active ref
cannot be built, and the stale-pin raise used to state ONE of them unconditionally:

    WHY: the active ref names provider 'X', which is absent from config.json
         (its app isn't installed or configured)
    FIX: install 'X' in the App Store, or rebind 'chat' to an available model in
         Settings → Models

For the measured case that motivated the issue — a ``vllm``-typed entry that IS in
config.json and IS in the live registry, whose type simply has no registered factory —
that ``why`` is false and the first half of that ``fix`` is unactionable: ``X`` is the
provider ENTRY name the user typed in Settings, not an app name, so there is nothing
called ``X`` to install in the App Store.

One test per distinguishable cause, each asserting the message names THAT cause and gives
an action that would resolve it. The last one is the deliberate generic: it says it is
unsure instead of asserting a specific wrong cause.

"The model name is not offered by that provider" is NOT a cause here, and that is
measured rather than assumed: ``_resolve_from_config_registry`` threads ``model_override``
to the factory unvalidated (``provider_bridge`` build kwargs), so a wrong model id does
not make it return ``None`` — a factory that rejects one lands in the generic branch,
which is why that branch names the model id.
