"""EA-5's pinned-upstream path: a client record names WHERE its traffic is forwarded.

The clause under test is "forward to a client-record ``upstream`` ProviderEntry". The
happy path is the least interesting thing here, so it gets one test; the rest are about
the two properties that make a *writable* egress binding safe to have at all:

* **``upstream`` is a provider NAME, never a URL.** The destination host comes from the
  named entry's own ``options``/spec, so no value a client record can hold names a host
  the operator did not already configure. Pinned by resolving through the REAL registry
  and the REAL credential store rather than a stubbed ``_provider_upstream`` — a mock
  would assert the test's own arithmetic, and the property being claimed is precisely
  that the resolution is the shared one.
* **The egress allow-list pre-flights, and a denial reaches no socket.** Proved by TWO
  independent witnesses on every refusal: ``_forward`` (the module's sole egress point)
  is never entered, AND the stub upstream records no request. Either alone is weak —
  an un-entered ``_forward`` does not by itself rule out a connection opened elsewhere,
  and an untouched stub cannot tell "denied" from "dialed the wrong port". Beside each
  refusal sits a vacuity floor that allow-lists the same host and forwards, so a red in
  the refusal test means the guard, not a broken fixture.

The credential-confusion negative is pinned too: the bytes leaving for the upstream must
carry the PROVIDER's secret and must not contain the inbound bearer, which is the failure
mode a proxy that "just forwards headers" has by construction.
