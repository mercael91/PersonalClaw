"""An app may not re-pin a dependency core owns (EI-12 D3).

App ``pythonDependencies`` are pip-installed into ``<home>/app-python``, which the gateway
loads AFTER its own environment (``apps/app_python.py``). So core's installed copy of a
package always wins the import, and an app pin it does not satisfy could never take
effect — the app would run on core's version whatever it declared.
``app_manager._reject_core_dependency_conflicts`` refuses that class of pin before pip
runs, with the reason in the sentence. (A TRANSITIVE dependency needing another version of
a core package is refused by pip itself: every distribution the gateway imports is pinned
in its constraints — ``tests/test_app_python_packages.py`` holds that half.)

Isolation stops at the process: in-process provider code shares one interpreter, so an
app's packages are importable by everything in it. That is disclosed on the consent
surface rather than approximated; truly scoping them needs out-of-process providers, an
owner-scope seam change recorded BLOCKED in the plan.

Every assertion here runs through the real installer entry point, and the pip
subprocess is replaced with one that FAILS the test if it is ever reached — a refusal
that still spawned pip would not be a refusal.
