"""`{{secret:KEY}}` in a trigger's action config (§7 item 6 / decision 11 — S115).

🔴 THE DEFECT. Workflows have carried this form since WF2-R14 — the validator REJECTS an inline
credential and tells the author to use `{{secret:KEY}}`, and three surfaces say so in their error
text. A TRIGGER action did not resolve it. Driven before a line was written:

    bash action, command "echo tok={{secret:MY_KEY}}"
      → stdout: tok={{secret:MY_KEY}}       # the literal placeholder reached the shell

So a user following the documented pattern got a broken command, and the only way to make a trigger
authenticate was to paste the credential into `triggers.json` — a file snapshotted (S113), echoed
into run records, and rendered in the UI. The guidance and the mechanism disagreed, and the
mechanism won.

Every test injects its resolver, so none of them touches the real credential store.
