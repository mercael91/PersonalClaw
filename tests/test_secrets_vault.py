"""The secrets vault: presence-only reads, one-way writes, derived consumers (EI-10).

**The property this file exists to hold is structural, not behavioural.** "The API redacts the
value" is a claim about what a handler remembered to do; "the value never enters the read model"
is a claim about types and imports, and only the second survives a careless future edit. So the
rails come in two layers:

* :class:`TestPresenceIsStructural` reads the SOURCE. It asserts that neither the vault module nor
  its handler references any value-returning credential function, and that ``SecretPresence`` has
  no value-bearing field. A mutation that makes a route return a value reds this even if the route
  is never called.
* :class:`TestNoValueCrossesTheWire` DRIVES the routes with sentinel values planted in the store
  and asserts the sentinels appear in no response body, on every verb including the POST that just
  stored one. This is what catches a leak through a field the source scan did not think to name.

Neither layer alone is enough: the first cannot see a value smuggled through a helper it does not
recognise, and the second only covers the shapes a test happens to exercise.

⚠️  Every test here writes credentials, so the home is redirected TWICE — ``PERSONALCLAW_HOME`` and
``loader.config_dir`` — and the fixture ASSERTS the redirect landed before anything is written,
following ``test_credential_migration.py``'s fixture exactly. A vault test that leaked into the
real ``~/.personalclaw/.env`` would be an unacceptable defect, not a flake. ``keyring`` is an
optional extra CI does not install; nothing here stubs it, so every write lands in the redirected
``.env`` and ``credential_names`` reads it back from there.
