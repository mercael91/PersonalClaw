# FIRST STATEMENT AFTER THE IMPORTS, DELIBERATELY. Point this interpreter's bytecode
# cache at a fresh per-run directory *before* anything a mutation could touch is
# imported — `personalclaw`, `harness`, the test modules, and pytest's own rewritten
# test bytecode all resolve their cache through the prefix this sets. Without it
# CPython validates a `.pyc` on `(int(mtime), size)`, so a same-length edit made
# inside one second — the exact shape of a mutation-testing cycle — runs the PREVIOUS
# bytecode and reports a result for code that is not on disk. `-B` does not fix that
# (it stops the interpreter WRITING a cache, not reading one). Nothing enforced this
# before, so no past "N mutations caught" claim was self-certifying; from here the run
# enforces the bytecode half — an interrupted run that leaves its mutation ON DISK is a
# different defect this cannot see (#2710). Rationale, measurements, the rejected
# alternative and the three files outside the rail: tests/pycache_guard.py. Proof that
# it works: tests/test_pycache_guard.py.

# `_GLOBAL_MCP_JSON` was deleted.) Measured under the guard above on a full run: every worker
# mkdir'd the real `~/.personalclaw` at import (so a fresh machine or CI runner has one created
# just by collecting), and 150+ tests read the owner's real skills, agent hooks and `mcp.json`
# through those frozen paths. Converting the rest is a product change with ~17 test sites that
# patch the constants
# (`test_agent_paths_resolve_at_call_time.py` records the debt); this closes the suite's exposure
# without it: until collection finishes, an unchosen home is ONE per-process scratch directory.
# After that the per-test redirect takes over — and a resolution that happens outside every test
# (an orphaned thread, a late first import between tests) reaches the real home, where the guard
# refuses it and names who did it. That is deliberate: a quarantine for those would hide them.

    """Make an UNSPECIFIED home mean a per-test tmp dir instead of the developer's
    real ``~/.personalclaw`` (CRE-8).

    The hazard, measured rather than assumed: a plain
    ``pytest -k "project or memory or knowledge or recall"`` appended **44,402 bytes** of
    `artifact_save`/`tool_invocation` rows to the user's real
    ``~/.personalclaw/security_events.jsonl`` and created/rewrote 62 more real-home entries
    (`tasks/*.json`, `codegraph/*.db`, `workspace/_ext/*/memory/*.md`, `prompts/`,
    `prompt_snippets/`, `learning.db`, `session_search.db`, `tokenjuice_savings.json`, …).
    Thirteen distinct writer families, and every one of them reached the real home through
    the same two seams: ``config.loader.config_dir()`` (153 call sites) and SEL's own
    ``sel._default_dir()``. Patching thirteen subsystems one at a time would have been
    thirteen fixtures guarding one seam, and the fourteenth subsystem would leak again.

    So this redirects those two seams, and ONLY when the caller expressed no preference:

    * ``$PERSONALCLAW_HOME`` set (to anything, **including the real home**) → pass through
      untouched. Several rails deliberately point it at the real home and assert a refusal
      (``test_cli_gateway_flags``'s ``--approval yolo`` rails, ``test_seed``'s main-home
      rails); redirecting an explicit choice would make those rails vacuous.
    * ``$HOME``/``Path.home()`` repointed by the test → pass through untouched. That test
      already isolated itself, and its assertions read back from *its* home.
    * neither → the resolution would be the real home purely by default. Redirect.

    Deliberately NOT done, both previously rejected in this repo and re-rejected here:
    a global ``$PERSONALCLAW_HOME`` for pytest jobs (CRE-6 removed exactly that: it takes
    precedence over ``Path.home()`` inside ``config_dir``, so it defeats the tests that
    assert env precedence and the ones that assert the default resolution), and a blanket
    ``Path.home`` patch (see ``_isolate_session_map`` — it breaks the real-home safety
    rails, and it would also silently redefine the unrelated ``Path.home()/".aws"`` and
    ``Path.home()/".ssh"`` paths that the artifact/task sensitivity tests assert on).

    What a fixture CANNOT reach: a home resolved into a module-level constant at import time.
    The real-home rail this suite used to run caught 147 real-home entries still landing in
    ``subagents/`` after this fixture was in place, because ``subagent_persistence`` froze
    ``config_dir() / "subagents"`` at first import — before any fixture exists. Three such
    constants were converted to call-time resolvers (``subagent_persistence._subagents_dir``,
    ``session_map._sessions_dir``, and a dead ``schedule._DEFAULT_DIR`` whose import-time
    ``config_dir()`` mkdir'd the real home merely by importing the module); the ones still
    frozen resolve inside the import window at the top of this file instead. A thread that
    outlives its test is the other shape this fixture cannot reach, because the patch is undone
    under it — ``tests/real_home_guard.py`` names the test that started it.

    Ordering matters: this fixture is declared BEFORE ``_reset_sel_singleton`` so it is set
    up first and torn down LAST. The singleton is cleared around every test, so the next
    ``sel()`` call constructs a fresh ``SecurityEventLog`` — and that construction must
    still find the redirected ``_default_dir``, or the leak comes straight back.

    to state the invariant structurally: **no fs-touching test can reach a real model dir

    Scoped to the NAMED real roots (see ``real_model_root_guard.FORBIDDEN_SUBPATHS``)

    `get_default_registry()` is a module-level singleton, so an entry a test registers outlives it
    and lands in whatever test shares the worker next. Snapshot-and-restore rather than a list of
    known names: three separate files leak (`test_can_resolve_use_case`, `test_provider_resolution_
    unify`, `test_provider_create_bedrock`), each under names of its own, and a name list silently
    stops covering the next one added.

    Measured symptoms — both deterministic in an xdist mix, both invisible in isolation, both in
    files with nothing to do with provider resolution:

    * a leaked CHAT-capable entry makes `workflows.preflight`'s `can_resolve_use_case` probe
      succeed, so `test_workflows_api.py`'s preflight-422 test got a 202 — a workflow run STARTED
      because another file had left a model provider behind;
    * a leaked `acp_agent` entry made `cli_doctor` exit 1 in `test_cli.py`.

    The singleton IDENTITY is restored too, and this is what the sharded suite exposed. Provider
    modules register their TYPES at IMPORT time — `personalclaw.llm.__init__` eager-imports
    `acp_agent`, wiring the `acp_agent` type — and those modules are then cached in `sys.modules`.
    So a test that calls `reset_default_registry()` / `set_default_registry(...)` (several do, in
    their own autouse fixtures: `test_ea5_capture_proxy`, `test_ea5_capture_client_upstream`,
    `test_scripted_provider_binding`, `test_evals_cell_provider`, `test_seed_local_model`) swaps in
    a FRESH, TYPELESS registry that the cached modules never re-populate — and the next test on
    the worker then dies with `unknown provider type 'acp_agent'`. It was invisible until #2720
    sharded the suite: with fewer xdist workers a resetting test and
    `test_provider_resolution_unify`'s `acp_agent` cases land on the same worker in sequence.
    Restoring the original object (which still carries its import-time type registrations) heals
    it; the `is` check makes the restore a no-op for the tests that already save/restore the
    singleton themselves (`test_acp_bundles`, `test_agent_providers_endpoint`). Registered TYPES on
    the original are still left alone (there is no `unregister_type`, so a mutation that would drop
    a type can only be a reset/swap, which this catches): `register_type` is how a test simulates
    an installed provider app, it is idempotent, and a type with no entry resolves nothing.

    carry comments explaining that "`NODE_REGISTRY` is process-global and another test
    module registers its own `ocr` stub into it", and one of them popped the leaked

    popping test routinely land on different workers and the stubs escape the file entirely.

    `uses_use_case = None`, so it runs no matter what the model bindings say. Both failures

    is the whole subtlety here. Core's backends are not registered at import time — they land
    the first time some test calls `ensure_nodes_registered()`, which then latches the memo.
    Rewinding the dict alone therefore un-registers core's own nodes permanently for that
    worker, because the next `ensure_nodes_registered()` sees the latch and returns early:
    measured, `test_runner_records_skip_reason_on_partial` went to `failed` (nothing ran at

    there. That reads exactly like a provider-boundary hole in the route (an app name in a core
    payload), which is the expensive part: the route names no app, the registry did. Same
    signature on CI shard 4 of #3441 — 1 failed, 8906 passed, in a diff that cannot own it.

    Snapshot-and-restore both dicts rather than dropping a list of known names, for the reason the
    guards above record: a name list silently stops covering the next app someone bundles.
