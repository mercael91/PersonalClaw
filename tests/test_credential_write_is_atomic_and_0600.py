"""The dotenv credential write has no creation window and no truncation window.

The `.env` writer (now `_dotenv_save_credentials`) used to do `ep.write_text(...)` and then
`ep.chmod(0o600)`. Two defects in that pair, and the final mode is identical either way — which
is why a mode-only assertion cannot tell the fixed code from the broken code:

* **A CREATION WINDOW.** `write_text` creates the file at the umask default (0644 under the common
  022) and the `chmod` narrowed it only *after* the secret was already on disk. On first creation
  the credential was world-readable for that window.
* **NO ATOMICITY.** A crash or a full disk mid-write left the file TRUNCATED — every other key in
  it lost — because the target was rewritten in place.

So the tests below assert the two things that DO distinguish: the call site (an atomic write asked
for 0600 up front) and the behaviour under a failed write (the previous credentials survive).

`apps/app_secret.py::_write_0600` fixes the umask half with `os.open(..., 0o600)` + `fchmod`; it
does not need atomicity because it writes one value to its own file. A credential file holding
every key needs both, which is what `atomic_write(mode=0o600, fsync=True)` gives.
